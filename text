                    FAQs about Graduate Student Unionization

     o [21]FAQs about Graduate Student Unionization

   In September 2021, a group of MIT graduate students known as the [22]MIT
   Graduate Student Union, affiliated with the [23]United Electrical, Radio &
   Machine Workers of America, announced a campaign to unionize MIT***s
   graduate student population.

   The following frequently asked questions provide answers to questions the
   community may have in light of the students*** organizing efforts.
   Students with questions about unions and unionization that are not
   addressed below may contact [24]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.

   Q: What is MIT's position on the formation of a graduate student union?

   A: MIT***s leaders do not believe that unionization represents the most
   constructive path forward for our graduate students. They are proud of
   MIT***s recent progress on behalf of its graduate students *** achieved
   through working together with graduate student leaders.

   However, MIT***s leaders respect the right of graduate students to review
   their options and make their own individual decisions about what***s best
   for them in their pursuit of their education. Like the students launching
   this effort, MIT***s leadership is committed to advancing a learning and
   work environment of mutual respect and care. In close collaboration with
   the GSC and other student leaders, the Institute and its schools have
   taken steps in recent years to invest in our graduate students and to
   foster positive work, learning, and living experiences during their time
   on campus.

  BEFORE A UNIONIZATION ELECTION AT MIT

   Q: How is a union selected?

   A: Typically, a group of employees who want a union to represent them will
   affiliate with an established labor union, which will attempt to organize
   a new chapter of that labor union. In this instance, the MIT Graduate
   Student Union (MIT GSU) has chosen to affiliate with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE). You can learn more
   about the UE on its [25]website.

   The first step in an organizing campaign is for organizers (who could be
   students and/or employees of the union) to ask students in a potential
   bargaining unit to either sign a membership card or an ***authorization
   card.*** Either card serves the same purpose of allowing the union to act
   as their exclusive representative for purposes of negotiating the terms
   and conditions of their employment and to allow the union to use the cards
   to support a showing of interest for purposes of filing with the National
   Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

   Based on their website information, it appears that the MIT GSU has chosen
   to use membership cards rather than authorization cards. The card reads as
   follows:

   Join the Union

   I hereby request and accept membership in the United Electrical, Radio and
   Machine Workers of America (UE), and authorize it to represent me, and in
   my behalf to negotiate and conclude all agreements as to hours of labor,
   wages, and all other conditions of employment.

   Thus, if a student signs such a card, they are actually becoming a member
   of the UE and, presumably, subject to whatever rules the UE may have for
   its members. This does not mean that the Institute must automatically
   recognize the UE as that particular student***s representative, but it
   does mean that the student is now a member of the UE.

   If the union can collect enough membership cards (or authorization cards)
   to constitute a valid ***showing of interest,*** the union can file a
   ***representation petition*** with the NLRB requesting a secret-ballot
   election to determine if the union should be the exclusive representative
   of a group of employees which the union considers to be an appropriate
   unit.

   The NLRB considers 30 percent of such a proposed unit to be a valid
   threshold for processing a representation petition. The NLRB will hold
   hearings, if necessary, to determine whether the union***s proposed unit
   is appropriate or not.

   However, if the union collects signed membership or authorization cards
   from more than 50 percent of the members in the petitioned-for unit, it
   might request MIT to voluntarily recognize and bargain with the union
   without holding an election. MIT would be under no obligation to agree to
   a voluntary recognition and could insist on an NLRB election.

    1. If there is a union election, would it involve all graduate students?
    2. No. It would only involve graduate students in the bargaining unit.
       Graduate students who are outside the bargaining unit (as agreed by
       MIT or deemed appropriate by the National Labor Relations Board) would
       not be eligible to vote in an election.

   Q: What flexibility do student unions have to affiliate with national
   unions, versus forming their own?

   A: Students are free to affiliate with either a national union or to form
   their own independent union. After a union has been certified by the
   National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), however, it is difficult to change
   union affiliations. So, in this case, if the UE petitions the NLRB for an
   election and an election is held where the majority of voting graduate
   students in the unit vote in favor of UE representation, the NLRB will
   certify the UE as the sole bargaining representative for the certified
   unit members. Once a union is certified by the National Labor Relations
   Board (NLRB), [26]the union may not be removed unless decertified by the
   NLRB.

   Q: What are my rights if a union organizer or a fellow student asks me to
   sign a membership or an authorization card?

   A: It is your decision whether or not you want to sign a membership or an
   authorization card, and all students have the right to sign, or refuse to
   sign, without coercion from anyone and without retaliation. The law
   protects your right not to engage in union activity as well as your right
   to engage in such activity. Because signing the card has important
   implications, you should understand what your signature represents before
   you sign it.

   Q: I signed a membership/authorization card with the United Electrical,
   Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) but have changed my mind. May I
   revoke my card?

   A: While MIT has no role to play on this issue, we note that any graduate
   student who signs a membership/authorization card with the UE may request
   to revoke their card. Normally, they would be able to do so by sending a
   signed letter to the UE requesting that their card be revoked.

   Students who have signed a union card are free to vote against the union
   in an election. Cards have no further meaning once an election is
   scheduled.

   Q: Will MIT share graduate students*** email addresses or other contact
   information with the union?

   A: Not unless legally required to do so. MIT respects the privacy of our
   graduate students and generally does not disclose personal information
   about them to third parties except with their consent, or to
   MIT-sanctioned organizations and MIT personnel on a need-to-know basis.
   Further, many of our graduate students may also be considered employees
   under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and MIT does not provide
   personal information about employees to organizing unions outside the
   formal National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.

   However, MIT would be required to provide information about graduate
   students to the NLRB in response to any petition for representation that
   may be filed. If this occurs, then the union would have access to the same
   information MIT provides to the NLRB. This information would include
   addresses, job classifications, phone numbers, and personal email
   addresses. MIT would have to disclose such information to the NLRB and to
   the union in the event of a scheduled NLRB election.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  AFTER A UNIONIZATION ELECTION AT MIT

   Q: If the union should win an election, what would happen next?

   A: MIT would be required to recognize the union as the exclusive
   bargaining representative of all graduate students in the certified unit.
   This would mean, among other things, that the Institute would not be able
   to work with any other body or organization, including the MIT Graduate
   Student Council, on matters affecting wages, hours, and working conditions
   for those in the certified unit, nor could MIT negotiate directly with any
   individual member of the unit on any matter affecting wages, hours, and
   working conditions, unless otherwise authorized by the contract.

   It also would mean that both parties *** MIT and the union *** would have
   to meet their obligation to negotiate in good faith for that initial
   collective bargaining agreement. First contracts can take a very long time
   to finalize: [27]A June 2021 Bloomberg Law analysis estimated that, on
   average, it takes 409 days for new unions and their employers to sign
   their first collective bargaining agreement; in all cases involving
   student unions at private universities, more than a year elapsed between a
   successful unionization vote and arrival at a ratified initial contract.
   At Harvard University, this process took almost two years, and at Columbia
   University, there is still no contract four years after the union***s
   certification.

   Q: Would all graduate students at MIT be part of a union?

   A: Not necessarily. It depends on whether the graduate student is
   performing work for the Institute (as opposed to solely academic work
   toward their degree) and how the bargaining unit is defined. While all
   graduate students who provide instructional or research work to MIT for
   compensation (e.g., RAs/TAs) are likely to be eligible to unionize under
   current law, the composition of a particular bargaining unit depends on
   who the union seeks to include in the petition; whether MIT agrees or not;
   and, if there is a dispute about the scope of the bargaining unit, how the
   NLRB resolves the dispute.

   While the organizing union first proposes the bargaining unit that it
   wishes to represent, MIT would have the right to challenge the
   appropriateness of that unit. Ultimately, if no agreement on the unit can
   be reached, the NLRB will determine the matter through its adjudicatory
   process.

   Q: If a union won an election at MIT, and I am in the certified bargaining
   unit, would I have to join the union?

   A: Whether you have to actually join the union and pay dues or fees
   depends on subsequent negotiations between the union and MIT.

   It is typical for a union to request a contract provision requiring
   everyone in the unit to join the union or pay an agency fee to the union
   as a condition of employment. A union can negotiate a provision in a
   collective bargaining agreement that requires non-members to pay an agency
   fee to the union in order for the student to be able to continue holding
   an appointment within the bargaining unit. The agency fee is usually about
   the same amount as union dues, but sometimes less. If such provisions are
   negotiated into the contract, then all members of the unit would have to
   abide by them. Otherwise the union could lawfully insist that the union
   member be terminated from their bargaining unit position if they do not
   pay the agency fee. Any of these concepts must be negotiated, and MIT may
   or may not agree to such proposals.

   Regardless of whether you formally join the union, or whether an agency
   fee is required for non-members, the union would become your exclusive
   bargaining representative in the event the union were to win an election.
   Therefore, it is also important to understand that, even if you don***t
   join the union, the terms of the contract with the union are binding on
   all employees in the bargaining unit.

   Q: Could MIT make exceptions to provisions in a collective bargaining
   agreement to accommodate the needs of individual graduate students?

   A: As a general rule, no. MIT would be bound by the provisions of the
   collective bargaining agreement. Unless such exceptions are provided for
   in the contract or otherwise agreed to by the union, they are not
   permitted.

   For example, if a contract set parameters on the work hours for a research
   assistant, an individual graduate student would not be able to make
   personal arrangements with their advisor or PI to work outside those
   parameters, unless the contract provided for exceptions or unless the
   union agreed to such arrangements.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  UNION DUES, NEGOTIATIONS, AND BEYOND

   Q: What would the union dues be at MIT if students voted for a union?

   A: Every union sets its own dues structure. Some do it by setting dues
   based on fixed amounts per month; others use a percentage of compensation.

   At New York University, for example, graduate students who are members of
   the United Auto Workers of America (UAW) pay 2 percent of their hourly
   wages during the semesters in which they are employed, and the dues are
   automatically deducted from every paycheck. In addition to dues, the UAW
   charges each member an initiation fee of approximately $50. Union dues at
   Harvard University, where the UAW is also the representative of student
   workers, are 1.44 percent of all compensation that the graduate student
   union member receives.

   It remains unclear how the UE would structure its dues for MIT graduate
   students, although it seems that they, too, would charge 1.44 percent of
   compensation. Thus, some MIT graduate student union members might expect
   to pay the union about $550 annually. If there is a ***union shop*** or
   union security clause in any collective bargaining agreement, non-members
   in the bargaining unit may also be required to pay an agency fee. Agency
   fees are often the same amount as union dues; sometimes less.

   Q: In collective bargaining negotiations, can MIT propose its own
   provisions or changes from the status quo?

   A: Yes. Both MIT and the union representatives are free to propose any
   items or provisions for the contract, including changes from the status
   quo involving wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.

   Employers and unions are required by federal law to bargain collectively
   over ***wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.***
   Other issues of importance to many students *** such as local housing
   costs and participation in Institute decision-making *** are outside the
   scope of what is required to be negotiated.

   Q: How are student interests represented in these negotiations? Will I get
   input into what should be negotiated into the contract? Who will the
   leadership of the union be?

   A: It is up to the union to determine who serves in the leadership, who
   serves on the negotiating team, and how it solicits and/or considers input
   from its members.

   Q: If a union wins an election, will my stipend increase? What about
   benefits?

   A: The law requires negotiations over compensation (i.e., payment for work
   provided by the union members to MIT). Stipends that are strictly
   financial aid support, and not linked to work provided by graduate
   students in the bargaining unit, would not be subject to collective
   bargaining.

   For stipends that are linked to, for example, TA or RA appointments, and
   therefore subject to bargaining, there is no guarantee that any union can
   obtain improvements *** or if so, how much *** as all such matters are
   subject to negotiations. It is fair to say that usually some increases in
   compensation can be found in most contracts. However, the amount is
   subject to negotiations and is not necessarily greater than what could
   have been achieved without a union. For example, MIT has raised stipends
   every year in recent memory without a union. Benefits are also mandatory
   subjects of bargaining, but may or may not change as a result of
   collective bargaining.

   Q: Would a graduate student union at MIT dictate the number of hours I can
   work as a graduate research assistant for positions included in the
   bargaining unit?

   A: We don***t know. This would first depend on the type of unit that is
   certified and whether research assistants are included in the unit. For
   example, research assistants are not included in the bargaining units at
   Brandeis University or at New York University. On the other hand, they are
   included in the Harvard University bargaining unit.

   If they are included in the unit, then the number of hours of work is
   subject to bargaining if the graduate student is receiving compensation
   for such research. Many graduate assistant contracts have detailed
   workload provisions that include expectations, as well as limitations, on
   hours of work.

   Q: What impact could a union have on research activities, such as
   attendance at conferences, engaging in fieldwork, or research conducted at
   other activities?

   A: We don***t know. To the extent that such activities are part of a
   research assistantship, funding for attendance at conferences, travel, and
   other activities could be subject to negotiation with the union.

   Q: What would happen to the MIT Graduate Student Council if a union was
   created?

   A: With a union created, the Graduate Student Council would no longer be
   permitted to discuss or negotiate with the MIT administration any issues
   concerning wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment for
   members of the bargaining unit. Under federal labor law, once a union wins
   an election, it becomes the exclusive bargaining representative over all
   terms and conditions of employment. It would be illegal for the Institute
   to continue to deal with the GSC on such matters.

   Q: What is the process for changing affiliations after a union has been
   established?

   A: Once a union is certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB),
   [28]the union may not be removed unless decertified by the NLRB. Similar
   to the certification process, employees seeking to remove or replace the
   existing union with a different union must get at least 30 percent of
   their coworkers to sign cards in order to file a petition asking the NLRB
   to conduct an election.

  STUDENT OPINIONS FOR AND AGAINST UNIONIZATION

   Q: What have students said in support of the current unionization effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization effort
   on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The Tech:

     o October 21, 2021: [29]***With a union, graduate working conditions
       become an institutional priority***
     o November 15, 2021: [30]***Graduate student-leaders: only a union can
       secure real change at MIT***
     o November 15, 2021: [31]***The MIT GSU and UE will bring a history of
       social justice to the future of MIT***
     o November 15, 2021: [32]***International student workers deserve fair
       treatment***

   Q: What have students said in opposition to the current unionization
   effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization effort
   on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The Tech:

     o October 6, 2021: [33]***Some concerns about unionization from a
       graduate student***
     o October 21, 2021: [34]***Why we do not need a graduate student union
       at MIT***
     o November 3, 2021: [35]***The UE isn***t the union the GSU claims it
       is***

   Q: A student-authored website and op-ed in The Tech have raised concerns
   about the UE***s finances and policy positions. What is the basis for
   those concerns?

   A: [36]The student-authored [37]Tech [38]piece highlights concerns about
   the MIT Graduate Student Union***s decision to partner with the UE.
   Students have also created an information site ([39]www.uenotformit.org)
   that outlines their reservations about the UE, concluding, ***There is no
   need for us to bind ourselves to an organization that we would be
   financially supporting, but which would tie our hands in decisions of
   policy and actively seek to undermine research in various fields.***

   Q: On its website, the UE calls for ***a moratorium on the construction of
   any additional nuclear fission power plants.*** What does that mean for
   MIT graduate students in nuclear science and engineering?

   A: **We don***t yet know how these policy positions might impact potential
   future bargaining between MIT and a graduate student union. The initial
   decisions about what the union might ask for in bargaining would be up to
   the union and its membership.

   Q: I***ve heard that the UE has taken a position of ***Boycott, Divestment
   and Sanctions (BDS)*** against Israel in connection with the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What does this mean, and what can I do if I
   have concerns about this?

   A: The UE***s position on ***Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)*** is
   referenced [40]here, and other UE policy stances are available [41]here.
   We have received information suggesting that some graduate students are
   uncomfortable with the UE***s BDS position.

   MIT has no role, and will not have any role, in setting union policies. We
   encourage all graduate students to review these policy positions as part
   of making fully informed decisions about whether to support or join a
   union aligned with the UE.

   Q: I***m a graduate student who opposes the unionization effort. What am I
   allowed to do?

   A: Graduate students who oppose the unionization effort have the same
   rights as those who support the union, and are entitled to take steps to
   organize and make their viewpoints heard. For example, consistent with MIT
   policies, graduate students who oppose the union may set up meetings with
   other students, create and promote websites explaining their positions,
   put up posters, hand out leaflets, talk to the press, and generally use
   all the same communication channels as the student organizers who support
   the union. Students might also consider researching graduate student
   unionization activities at other universities, and the steps taken by
   students who supported or opposed those unionization efforts.

   Q: Can MIT provide any support to graduate students who oppose the
   unionization effort?

   A: MIT is not permitted to provide support to graduate students who oppose
   the unionization effort, or to those who support it. However, consistent
   with MIT***s policies, every graduate student has the right to express
   their views on this topic and is permitted to make their viewpoints heard.

   Q: I***ve heard that MIT filed an anti-union brief in court a few years
   ago. What***s the background on that?

   A: In 2016, MIT joined eight other research universities in filing a
   ***friend of the court*** brief with the National Labor Relations Board
   (NLRB), asking that the NLRB follow its 2004 decision involving Brown
   University. In that decision, the NLRB concluded that graduate assistants
   are students, not employees.

   MIT joined this brief because the Institute believes that its relationship
   with its graduate teaching and research assistants is substantially an
   educational one, and that unionization of graduate students may not be the
   most constructive approach to the multifaceted relationship between the
   student and the Institute.

   In the 2016 case, the NLRB overturned its 2004 position, ruling that
   graduate assistants can be both students and employees. While MIT joined
   this brief with several peer institutions, the Institute accepts and
   respects the NLRB ruling and fully supports the right of students to make
   independent decisions on whether to support unionization.

   Q: What other opinions have been shared regarding the current unionization
   effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization effort
   on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The Tech:

     o October 28, 2021: [42]***A $6,000 bill and inadequate coverage: How
       MIT health insurance fails graduate workers***
     o November 3, 2021: [43]***Director of MIT Medical responds to ***How
       MIT health insurance fails graduate workers******
     o November 9, 2021: [44]***Institute for Work and Employment Research
       faculty comment on potential graduate student unionization***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  GENERAL INFORMATION ON UNIONS AND THE UNIONIZATION PROCESS

   Q: What is the NLRB?

   A: The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is a federal agency created
   to enforce the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), a federal law to
   protect the rights of employees and employers. The law protects the rights
   of employees to choose or reject union representation.

   Q: What is a union?

   A: A union, or labor organization, is any organization or association of
   any kind in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose,
   in whole or in part, of dealing with employers on wages, benefits, hours,
   grievances or other terms or conditions of employment. A union that
   represents a majority of employees in an ***appropriate bargaining
   unit,*** and that has been certified by the NLRB following an election or
   voluntarily recognized by an employer, serves as the representative of
   that bargaining unit on all such matters involving wages, hours, and other
   terms and conditions of employment. An appropriate bargaining unit is a
   group of employees who share a clear and identifiable community of
   interest sufficient to be represented by a union.

   A union that has been certified by the NLRB, or that has been voluntarily
   recognized by an employer, negotiates a contract (also known as a
   collective bargaining agreement) on behalf of the bargaining unit to
   establish the terms and conditions of employment, including such things as
   wages, hours of work, benefits, and other working conditions. A union also
   represents its members when disputes arise over the terms of the contract.

   Q: What are union dues?

   A: Dues are the cost of membership in a union. They are used to cover the
   costs of negotiating a contract, contract administration and resolutions
   of grievances (claims of breach of contract). In addition, unions also use
   dues for the purpose of organizing employees at other employers, and to
   make political contributions.

   Q: What is the election process to form a union?

   A: The election process is conducted and supervised by representatives of
   the NLRB. An election is typically held within approximately three or four
   weeks after the filing of a representation petition by the union, but the
   timing may differ depending upon how the NLRB treats outstanding
   bargaining unit issues, and how long it takes to resolve those issues.
   Once an election date is set, secret ballot voting would likely take place
   in a central location at a designated date and time, or by a mail-in
   process, as determined by the NLRB.

   The election outcome is determined by a simple majority of those who
   actually vote, not by a majority of all eligible voters. Union
   representation will be determined by voters, and will be binding on both
   voters and non-voters in the proposed bargaining unit. Therefore, it is
   important that all members of a proposed bargaining unit vote, even if
   they are not interested in unionization.

   Those who have already signed membership or authorization cards are not
   obligated to vote in favor of the union during the secret ballot election:
   They are free to change their mind. Once a petition is filed with the
   NLRB, and the showing of interest is confirmed, membership or
   authorization cards usually serve no further purpose.

   Q: What does the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) say regarding
   negotiations?

   A: Section 8(d) of the NLRA states:

   For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the
   performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the
   representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in
   good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of
   employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising
   thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any
   agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does
   not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a
   concession.

   Q: Is anything required to be in a collective bargaining agreement?

   A: No, the NLRA does not require that any particular right or provision be
   part of a contract. Collective bargaining agreements normally have
   provisions on compensation and benefits, workload and assignments, hours
   of work, grievance procedures and a variety of other provisions, but no
   particular provisions are mandated by law. You may find some contracts
   have a particular provision but another contract might not *** it all
   depends on what those parties have chosen to include in their agreements.
   The law requires good-faith negotiations over mandatory subjects of
   bargaining. However, the law specifically does not require either party to
   make a particular concession or to agree to a particular proposal during
   negotiations.

   Q: What might be covered in a union contract?

   A: The NLRA requires employers and unions to bargain collectively over
   ***wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.*** These
   are called mandatory subjects of bargaining, over which the parties
   mustnegotiate.

   Other topics of interest that do not fall under the umbrella of mandatory
   negotiations might be addressed by the parties as ***permissive***
   subjects *** topics over which neither side is required to negotiate.
   Items such as the hiring process and housing costs would fall into that
   category. The NLRB has not yet addressed with any specificity what
   ***terms and conditions of employment*** are in the graduate student
   context. In a case involving Columbia University graduate students, the
   NLRB stated that academic decisions remain the prerogative of the
   university, but what constitutes an academic versus a non-academic
   decision is not yet clear.

   There may be many issues of importance to our students that would not be
   considered mandatory subjects of bargaining under the law, such as
   concerns about student housing.

   Some guidance about the terms and conditions that may be addressed in a
   contract can be gleaned from examining other graduate student contracts.
   For example, the contract between Harvard University and its graduate
   student teaching and research assistants represented by the United Auto
   Workers (UAW) covers numerous terms and conditions of employment such as
   salaries, benefits, working hours, and grievance procedures;
   nondiscrimination provisions; leaves of absence; job postings; and access
   to offices.

   However, many rights are retained by Harvard. In the Harvard contract with
   the UAW, the university retains the exclusive right to determine and
   control the university***s mission, objectives, priorities, operations,
   and resources, among many other rights. Harvard also retains the right to
   control ***all matters of academic judgment and decision-making, including
   ***who is taught, what is taught, how it is taught and who does the
   teaching.****** All matters affecting research methodology and materials,
   and external grants including application, selection, funding,
   administration, usage, accountability, and termination are also retained
   by Harvard.

   Also, there are great variations in union contracts because it is up to
   the parties to those contracts to decide what they will agree to and what
   they will not. The appearance of a clause in one contract *** no matter
   what it is *** does not guarantee that it will appear in an MIT contract
   if the union were to be elected.

   Q: How many graduate student union contracts are there around the country?

   A: There are about 42 graduate student contracts, according to the
   National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education
   and the Professions. The majority are at public universities; there are
   only nine graduate student union contracts in the private sector, at
   American University, Brandeis University, Brown University, Columbia
   University, Georgetown University, Harvard University, The New School, New
   York University, and Tufts University.

   Q: Does the UE represent graduate students anywhere else?

   A: To the best of our knowledge, the only contract they currently have in
   place is at the University of Iowa.

   Q: Are state labor laws different from the NLRA?

   A: Yes. In many cases, state and federal laws differ significantly when it
   comes to issues such as bargaining topics, negotiation impasse procedures,
   the right to strike, and required union membership. For example, strikes
   are prohibited under most state laws, making strikes rare at public
   universities, but strikes are legal in the private sector.

   Many state laws also, for example, specify what issues are considered
   ***terms and conditions of employment,*** and therefore subject to
   collective bargaining, and what issues are ***academic,*** and therefore
   not subject to collective bargaining. Federal law is not tailored to
   address the issues of academic and educational matters related to graduate
   student activities.

   Q: How long do student union contract negotiations typically take? Have
   students represented by unions at other universities gone on strike?

   A: [45]A June 2021 Bloomberg Law analysis estimated that, on average, it
   takes 409 days for new unions and their employers to sign their first
   collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The analysis is depicted in the
   following chart:

   The table below provides examples of the length of student union contract
   negotiations at other institutions of higher education based on available
   information, and also notes when student-authorized strikes have taken
   place:

   * Negotiations began in October 2018 and ended in June 2020, and included
   a 29-day strike in December 2019. The parties initially agreed only to a
   one-year contract, which expired on June 30, 2021. The parties agreed to a
   second contract, which was ratified in November 2021, with 70.6 percent of
   voters in support of the new deal, and after a three-day strike and the
   threat of a second strike.

   ** Columbia University has not yet reached an initial agreement with its
   union. The NLRB election was held in December 2016; the NLRB issued its
   decision certifying the union on December 16, 2017. Negotiations for a
   first contract started in February 2019 and a tentative agreement was
   reached in April 2021 but was voted down by union members. In July 2021,
   union members elected a new union bargaining committee after all 10
   members of the union***s bargaining committee stepped down. In September
   2021, union members authorized a strike and on November 3, 2021, the
   strike commenced.

   *** Bargaining began in [76]September 2017; strike in 5/2018 following 63+

               Important update on graduate student unionization

   February 01, 2022

   To the members of the MIT community,

   We write to update you on efforts by a group of MIT graduate students to
   form a union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine
   Workers of America (UE).

   Please see below a letter we sent earlier today to our graduate students,
   sharing the news that all eligible graduate students will be given the
   opportunity to decide on unionization through an independent election
   conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. This is the latest step
   in a process set in motion last September, when the union organizers
   publicly launched their campaign.

   We respect the right of graduate students to review their options and to
   make their own decisions about whether unionization and affiliation with
   the UE is in their best interest.

   However, we do not believe that unionization is the most constructive path
   forward for our graduate students. Today's letter to graduate students
   explains that position. For those who are interested in learning more, we
   invite you to visit [13]grad-union.mit.edu, created to help every graduate
   student cast an informed vote on this important issue.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

   Martin A. Schmidt
   Provost

Letter to graduate students

Highlights

     o MIT has declined a request to recognize a graduate student union
       without an election: "All eligible students should have the chance to
       choose for themselves."
     o Institute senior leaders do not believe a graduate student union will
       produce better, or quicker, outcomes for students: "Promises about
       what collective bargaining can deliver have been overstated."
     o At MIT, we solve problems best together, and our longstanding model
       for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic, and
       effective.
     o All graduate students should cast an informed vote after considering
       both sides in this debate and visiting [14]grad-union.mit.edu.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students,

   As you have likely heard, some MIT graduate students are seeking to form a
   union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of
   America (UE). Union organizers have now filed a petition with the National
   Labor Relations Board (NLRB), requesting an election to determine if
   eligible graduate students will be represented by a union.

   Last month, the Institute declined the UE's request to recognize such a
   union without an election. MIT's senior leaders believe that all eligible
   students should have the chance to choose for themselves, through an
   independent election, whether unionization is in their best interests.

   In recent months, the UE has shared its views via social media, press
   releases, and op-eds -- but no one can make an informed choice having
   heard only one side. We write to you now to share MIT's senior leaders'
   perspective on graduate student unionization; highlight what's at stake in
   this election; and to convey why, when the time comes, it's critical that
   you vote.

Making an informed choice

   Here are a few of the most important reasons why we believe that MIT's
   longstanding partnership with graduate students is a better path forward
   than unionization:

     o As students attending MIT to learn and to earn a graduate degree, your
       connection to the Institute is broader than an employee/employer
       relationship. But beyond wages, benefits, hours, and other
       straightforward terms and conditions of employment, there are many
       issues that collective bargaining is not well-suited to resolve.

       Unfortunately, promises about what collective bargaining can deliver
       have been overstated and the burdens you could face if the union is
       successful have been understated: a bureaucratic, lengthy labor
       bargaining process; the potential cost of dues; and the detrimental
       effect that strikes and other disruptions may have on your learning
       and research.

       At MIT, we solve problems best together, and [15]our longstanding
       model for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic,
       and effective. Your seat at the table is established and secure, and
       [16]yields real results -- on issues including stipends, student
       support, medical benefits, immigration matters, transitional funding,
       and fostering a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse community.

       This existing structure serves all graduate students, and reflects the
       fact that your connections with MIT are nuanced, varied, and in most
       cases, exceptionally rewarding. It also provides more flexibility than
       a union could in responding to graduate students' varied needs across
       an institution as diverse as ours.


     o Finally, once installed, labor unions are essentially permanent.
       Unions do not stand for re-election. This is not an experiment: When
       you cast your vote, you are making a choice not only on behalf of
       current students, but also the many thousands of graduate students who
       will succeed you over the decades.


Building a better MIT together

   Like every institution, MIT will always have room for improvement. Those
   of us who have devoted our lives to MIT, and to making it a place of
   excellence and belonging for generations of our students, are deeply aware
   that we must always strive to do better.

   While we acknowledge that there is always more to be done, we are proud of
   the significant progress we have made in recent years, thanks to our
   collaboration with graduate student leaders. We have serious concerns that
   a graduate student union aligned with the UE will not be able to build on
   these successes and produce better outcomes for you.

   Those of us who lead MIT are personally invested in your success -- and
   having been graduate students ourselves, we understand the challenges you
   face. No matter the election outcome, we will continue to work alongside
   you both to help you succeed academically and to make MIT better for all
   of our students.

   We will have more to say in the coming weeks, and we will share details
   about how you can vote once the NLRB has set the election. As a starting
   point, though, we encourage you to visit [17]grad-union.mit.edu, and to
   discuss this very important decision with your fellow students. There is
   much for you to consider, and a lot is riding on your decision.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles

           Casting an informed vote on graduate student unionization

   February 01, 2022

Highlights

     o MIT has declined a request to recognize a graduate student union
       without an election: "All eligible students should have the chance to
       choose for themselves."
     o Institute senior leaders do not believe a graduate student union will
       produce better, or quicker, outcomes for students: "Promises about
       what collective bargaining can deliver have been overstated."
     o At MIT, we solve problems best together, and our longstanding model
       for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic, and
       effective.
     o All graduate students should cast an informed vote after considering
       both sides in this debate and visiting [13]grad-union.mit.edu.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students,

   As you have likely heard, some MIT graduate students are seeking to form a
   union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of
   America (UE). Union organizers have now filed a petition with the National
   Labor Relations Board (NLRB), requesting an election to determine if
   eligible graduate students will be represented by a union.

   Last month, the Institute declined the UE's request to recognize such a
   union without an election. MIT's senior leaders believe that all eligible
   students should have the chance to choose for themselves, through an
   independent election, whether unionization is in their best interests.

   In recent months, the UE has shared its views via social media, press
   releases, and op-eds -- but no one can make an informed choice having
   heard only one side. We write to you now to share MIT's senior leaders'
   perspective on graduate student unionization; highlight what's at stake in
   this election; and to convey why, when the time comes, it's critical that
   you vote.

Making an informed choice

   Here are a few of the most important reasons why we believe that MIT's
   longstanding partnership with graduate students is a better path forward
   than unionization:

     o As students attending MIT to learn and to earn a graduate degree, your
       connection to the Institute is broader than an employee/employer
       relationship. But beyond wages, benefits, hours, and other
       straightforward terms and conditions of employment, there are many
       issues that collective bargaining is not well-suited to resolve.

       Unfortunately, promises about what collective bargaining can deliver
       have been overstated and the burdens you could face if the union is
       successful have been understated: a bureaucratic, lengthy labor
       bargaining process; the potential cost of dues; and the detrimental
       effect that strikes and other disruptions may have on your learning
       and research.

       At MIT, we solve problems best together, and [14]our longstanding
       model for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic,
       and effective. Your seat at the table is established and secure, and
       [15]yields real results -- on issues including stipends, student
       support, medical benefits, immigration matters, transitional funding,
       and fostering a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse community.

       This existing structure serves all graduate students, and reflects the
       fact that your connections with MIT are nuanced, varied, and in most
       cases, exceptionally rewarding. It also provides more flexibility than
       a union could in responding to graduate students' varied needs across
       an institution as diverse as ours.


     o Finally, once installed, labor unions are essentially permanent.
       Unions do not stand for re-election. This is not an experiment: When
       you cast your vote, you are making a choice not only on behalf of
       current students, but also the many thousands of graduate students who
       will succeed you over the decades.


Building a better MIT together

   Like every institution, MIT will always have room for improvement. Those
   of us who have devoted our lives to MIT, and to making it a place of
   excellence and belonging for generations of our students, are deeply aware
   that we must always strive to do better.

   While we acknowledge that there is always more to be done, we are proud of
   the significant progress we have made in recent years, thanks to our
   collaboration with graduate student leaders. We have serious concerns that
   a graduate student union aligned with the UE will not be able to build on
   these successes and produce better outcomes for you.

   Those of us who lead MIT are personally invested in your success -- and
   having been graduate students ourselves, we understand the challenges you
   face. No matter the election outcome, we will continue to work alongside
   you both to help you succeed academically and to make MIT better for all
   of our students.

   We will have more to say in the coming weeks, and we will share details
   about how you can vote once the NLRB has set the election. As a starting
   point, though, we encourage you to visit [16]grad-union.mit.edu, and to
   discuss this very important decision with your fellow students. There is
   much for you to consider, and a lot is riding on your decision.

    2. Student concerns about unionization

                      Student concerns about unionization

   The below FAQs present opinion pieces that students and others have
   written in opposition to forming a union aligned with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE). These FAQs also
   address questions that students have asked about the UE, and about the
   unionization process.

    Q: What have students said in opposition to the current unionization effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization effort
   on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The Tech:

     o October 6, 2021: [15]***Some concerns about unionization from a
       graduate student***
     o October 21, 2021: [16]***Why we do not need a graduate student union
       at MIT***
     o November 3, 2021: [17]***The UE isn***t the union the GSU claims it
       is***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: A student-authored website and op-ed in The Tech have raised concerns
    about the UE***s finances and policy positions. What is the basis for those
    concerns?

   A: [18]The student-authored Tech piece highlights concerns about the MIT
   Graduate Student Union***s decision to partner with the UE. Students have
   also created an information site ([19]www.uenotformit.org) that outlines
   their reservations about the UE, concluding, ***There is no need for us to
   bind ourselves to an organization that we would be financially supporting,
   but which would tie our hands in decisions of policy and actively seek to
   undermine research in various fields.***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: On its website, the UE calls for ***a moratorium on the construction of
    any additional nuclear fission power plants.*** What does that mean for MIT
    graduate students in nuclear science and engineering?

   A: **We don***t yet know how these policy positions might impact potential
   future bargaining between MIT and a graduate student union. Decisions
   about what the union might ask for in bargaining would be up to the union
   and its membership.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: I***ve heard that the UE has taken a position of ***Boycott, Divestment
    and Sanctions (BDS)*** against Israel in connection with the
    Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What does this mean, and what can I do if I
    have concerns about this?

   A: See the [20]UE***s position on ***Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions
   (BDS)***, and other [21]UE policy stances. We have received information
   suggesting that some graduate students and other community members are
   uncomfortable with the UE***s BDS position.

   MIT has no role, and will not have any role, in setting union policies. We
   encourage all graduate students to review these policy positions as part
   of making fully informed decisions about whether to support or join a
   union affiliated with the UE.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: I***m a graduate student who opposes the unionization effort. What am I
    allowed to do?

   A: Graduate students who oppose the unionization effort have the same
   rights as those who support the union, and are entitled to take steps to
   organize and make their viewpoints heard. For example, consistent with MIT
   policies, graduate students who oppose the union may set up meetings with
   other students, create and promote websites explaining their positions,
   put up posters, hand out leaflets, talk to the press, and generally use
   all the same communication channels as the students who support the union.
   Students might also consider researching graduate student unionization
   activities at other universities, and the steps taken by students at those
   universities who opposed those unionization efforts.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: Can MIT provide any support to graduate students who oppose the
    unionization effort?

   A: MIT is not permitted to provide support to graduate students who oppose
   the unionization effort, or to students who support the union. However,
   consistent with MIT policies, every graduate student has the right to
   express their views on this topic and is permitted to make their
   viewpoints heard.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: I***ve heard that MIT filed an anti-union brief in court a few years ago.
    Is that true?

   A: In 2016, MIT joined eight other research universities in filing a
   ***friend of the court*** brief with the National Labor Relations Board
   (NLRB), asking that the NLRB follow its 2004 decision involving Brown
   University. In that decision, the NLRB concluded that graduate assistants
   are primarily students, not employees, and had no rights under the
   National Labor Relations Act.

   MIT joined this brief because the Institute believes that its relationship
   with its graduate teaching and research assistants is substantially an
   educational one, and that unionization of graduate students is not the
   most constructive approach to the multifaceted relationship between the
   student and the Institute.

   In the 2016 case, the NLRB overturned its 2004 position, ruling that
   graduate assistants can be both students and employees. While MIT joined
   this brief with several peer institutions, the Institute accepts and
   respects the NLRB ruling and fully supports the right of graduate students
   to make fully informed decisions on whether to support unionization.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.**

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the story.
   MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions, discuss
   issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate information.

    2. Background on Unions and Unionization

                     Background on Unions and Unionization

   In September 2021, a group of MIT graduate students affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) announced a
   campaign to unionize MIT***s graduate student population. That group, the
   MIT Graduate Students Union, now reports sufficient backing to compel a
   vote, overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, of all graduate
   students within the proposed bargaining unit.

   MIT***s leaders respect the right of graduate students review their
   options and to make their own decisions about whether unionization and
   affiliation with the UE is in their best interest, in pursuit of their
   education. Like the students launching this effort, MIT is committed to
   advancing a learning and work environment of mutual respect and care. In
   close collaboration with graduate student leaders, the Institute and its
   schools have taken steps in recent years to invest in our graduate
   students and to foster positive work, learning, and living experiences
   during their time on campus.

Overview of unionization and the UE

     o A union exists for the purpose of dealing with an employer on issues
       related to employee wages, benefits, hours, grievances, and other
       terms of employment. A union that represents a majority of employees
       in what***s called ***an appropriate bargaining unit,*** and that has
       been certified by the National Labor Relations Board or voluntarily
       recognized by an employer, serves as the representative of that
       bargaining unit on all such terms and conditions of employment.
     o Working with the employer, an elected or recognized union negotiates a
       collective bargaining agreement or contract on behalf of the
       bargaining unit. A union also represents its members when disputes
       arise over the terms of the contract.
     o If the UE wins an election at MIT in an appropriate bargaining unit,
       the Institute will be required to recognize the UE as the exclusive
       bargaining representative of all graduate students in that unit. This
       means that MIT will not be able to work with the GSC or any other
       student organization on matters affecting the stipends and working
       conditions of those in the certified unit.
     o Dues are the cost of membership in a union, and the members of a union
       pay for the costs of negotiating a contract, contract administration,
       and resolution of claims of breaches of contracts. Union members***
       dues also subsidize the organizing of employees at other employers,
       and in some cases, may fund the union***s political contributions to
       candidates and causes. Whether or not a union shop *** in which
       everyone in the unit would have to join the union or pay dues or fees
       to it *** would be part of a collective bargaining agreement is a
       matter of negotiations between a union and the employer. Most unions
       propose a form of union shop to ensure a regular flow of money, among
       other reasons.
     o If the union is successful in the upcoming election at MIT, it is
       unclear what the UE***s dues structure would ultimately be for MIT
       students. Based on the UE***s charges to employees they represent at
       other organizations, some stipended/salaried union members at MIT
       might expect to pay an estimated $550 in annual dues to the UE.
       Whether or not all members of the bargaining unit would have to join
       the union, and/or pay fees to the union, would be a subject of
       negotiations.**
     o Even those in the bargaining unit who don***t become formal union
       members would still be subject to the terms of the collective
       bargaining contract. First contracts can take a year or longer to
       negotiate, and there is absolutely no guarantee that graduate
       students*** stipends, benefits, work hours, or grievance procedures
       would improve as a result of collective bargaining.**
     o The law requires good-faith negotiations, but the law does not require
       a particular outcome to that process. That***s a matter for the two
       parties at the bargaining table. Experience elsewhere shows that some
       things may improve with a union; but many things do not.**
     o There are many graduate student union contracts available online. We
       encourage you to review any of those contracts and to make your own
       judgment about how MIT***s graduate students compare to those at
       unionized universities.
     o Finally, if the UE is successful in any upcoming election, the
       presence of a union as the exclusive representative of the graduate
       students in the bargaining unit is not likely to change over time, and
       would not be subject to periodic elections. While there is a
       decertification process, this process is employed very rarely. The
       process requires the employees themselves to obtain signatures from 30
       percent of the bargaining unit, which allows them to file a
       decertification petition with the NLRB and hold an election,
       determined by a majority vote. Decertification petitions are not
       permitted for one year following the union***s certification by the
       NLRB. In addition, once a collective bargaining agreement is reached,
       decertification petitions are barred during the first three years of
       the agreement, except during a 30-day "window period" that begins 90
       days before the contract expiration date.

Facts about collective bargaining

     o The UE and MIT are legally required to engage in good-faith
       bargaining, but the law does not require that any particular proposal
       be put in a union contract, or that either side must make any
       particular concession or agree to any particular proposal. The law
       doesn***t guarantee any particular outcome to a round of bargaining.
     o Each side is free to reject any particular proposal from the other
       side.
     o Nothing ***automatically*** goes into a union contract. The fact that
       the UE or other unions have certain provisions in contracts elsewhere
       doesn***t guarantee that similar provisions will be included in a
       contract with MIT.
     o During collective bargaining, both MIT and the UE can make proposals
       to change the terms and conditions of employment for bargaining unit
       members.
     o The union can decide on its own methods for picking its
       representatives to serve as bargaining team members and union
       stewards.
     o There is no third party that makes a decision on what goes into an
       agreement if the UE and MIT reach an impasse. A mediator is often
       involved in helping the parties reach an agreement, but the mediator
       cannot force a settlement, or insist on any particular proposal.
     o Employees have a right to strike under the law, and are protected in
       that right. Strikes are often called by a union to pressure the
       employer. Strikes among graduate student workers have been quite
       common, such as those at Harvard, Columbia, and New York University.
       While the union may call a strike and direct its members not to
       perform any work for the duration of the strike, MIT is not obligated
       to compensate employees who are on strike, and in some situations may
       be entitled to recoup compensation already paid.**
     o No one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
     o In collective bargaining, members of a union can end up with more than
       they have now in some areas, the same, or in some areas, possibly
       less. We just don***t know *** and neither does the union.

   The experience of graduate student unions at peer institutions can also
   illustrate the limitations of a union in securing particular contract
   provisions. For example, Harvard***s Graduate Student Union ratified its
   first contract after 20 months of negotiations and 26 months after the
   union***s certification. Its second contract was settled in November 2021,
   following a three-day strike, the threat of a second strike, and eight
   months of intense negotiations.**

   While the Harvard union did achieve some gains in compensation, health
   care coverage, and legal funding for Title IX and other misconduct
   processes, what was included in the final contract was considerably less
   than the union***s stated goals. For example, the union did not advance
   several key priorities, including changes to housing; processes for
   addressing allegations of sexual misconduct, discrimination, and academic
   retaliation; campus policing protocols; mental health care policies and
   procedures; designation of union officers as confidential Title IX/sexual
   misconduct resources; racial justice training for all faculty and staff;
   and staffing in Harvard***s student mental health office.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.**

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the story.
   MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions, discuss
   issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate information.

    2. Fact-checking UE claims

                            Fact-checking UE claims

   The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) can promise
   whatever it wants during a unionization campaign, but it cannot guarantee
   that it will be able to back up these promises. It is essential that,
   before voting, all graduate students become fully informed about the
   issues at stake, so that each student can make their own determination
   about what***s in their best interest.

   Becoming fully informed requires that each student assess the validity of
   the UE***s assertions, and to weigh the potential benefits and costs of
   unionization. What follows is a fact check of some common UE claims:

   UE CLAIM: In addition to improving wages, hours, and other terms and
   conditions of employment, [15]the UE will force MIT to agree to a contract
   ***that reflects student priorities, codifies hard-fought wins, and
   ensures that we make progress towards a better MIT.***

   FACT CHECK: The truth is that MIT is only required by law to negotiate
   over compensation, hours of work, work duties, layoff and grievance
   procedures, and other terms and conditions of employment. The table below
   describes some of the mandatory and non-mandatory subjects of bargaining,
   as well as illegal subjects of bargaining.

   Some Mandatory       Some Non-Mandatory Subjects of  Some Illegal Subjects
   Subjects of          Bargaining                      of Bargaining**

   Work duties and      academic performance,

                        course and degree
                        requirements.**

                        Recognition clause defining the
                        bargaining unit

   * The NLRB generally does not consider employer housing to be a mandatory
   subject of bargaining if the employee is not forced to live in the
   provided housing. Graduate students may elect to utilize Institute housing
   because of their status as students, not because of their status as
   employees. They are not required to stay in MIT housing.

   ** Illegal subjects are those that cannot be legally bargained over by
   either party. They are subjects that would violate a law, and therefore
   cannot be entered into legally in a collective bargaining agreement, even
   if both parties agree to do so.

   *** [16]Federal laws and regulations limit the number of hours certain
   international students can work. Even if MIT and the UE both wanted to
   increase those hours, they would be unable to do so. Similarly, there are
   rules pertaining to international remote work that cannot be modified in a
   MIT-UE contract.

   The experience of graduate student unions at peer institutions can also
   illustrate the limitations of a union in securing particular contract
   provisions. For example, Harvard***s Graduate Student Union ratified its
   first contract after 20 months of negotiations and 26 months after the
   union***s certification. Its second contract was settled in November 2021,
   following a three-day strike, the threat of a second strike, and eight
   months of intense negotiations.**

   While the Harvard union did achieve some gains in compensation, health
   care coverage, and legal funding for Title IX and other misconduct
   processes, what was included in the final contract was considerably less
   than the union***s stated goals. For example, the union did not advance
   several key priorities, including changes to housing; processes for
   addressing allegations of sexual misconduct, discrimination, and academic
   retaliation; campus policing protocols; mental health care policies and
   procedures; designation of union officers as confidential Title IX/sexual
   misconduct resources; racial justice training for all faculty and staff;
   and staffing in Harvard***s student mental health office.**

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   UE CLAIM: A union will secure wins for graduate students much more quickly
   than MIT***s current committee processes.

   FACT CHECK: The Institute***s current annual processes for making
   adjustments and enhancements to [17]graduate student stipends and health
   insurance benefits typically take only a few months. Rates and benefits
   for the upcoming academic year are finalized, approved, and announced in
   April or May. Moreover, MIT***s close collaborative relationship with its
   graduate students often enables the Institute to move faster in addressing
   emerging needs than would be possible in negotiating a new contract with a
   union.

   Negotiating a collective bargaining agreement *** and specifically, the
   first agreement between MIT and the UE *** will likely take much longer
   than our current process, meaning students may not know their final
   compensation or benefits for the coming academic year until a contract is
   finalized and ratified through a vote of union members. Some current
   graduate students may graduate before an initial contract is reached and
   ratified.**

   It is unclear whether students*** compensation and benefits would remain
   at their current levels during the negotiation period, no matter how long
   negotiations take.

   [18]A June 2021 Bloomberg Law analysis estimated that, on average, it
   takes 409 days for new unions and their employers to sign a first
   collective bargaining agreement:

   The table below provides examples of the length of student union contract
   negotiations at other institutions of higher education based on available
   information, and also notes when student-authorized strikes have taken
   place:

   * Negotiations began in October 2018 and ended in June 2020, and included
   a 29-day strike in December 2019. The parties initially agreed only to a
   one-year contract, which expired on June 30, 2021. The parties agreed to a
   second contract, which was ratified in November 2021, with 70.6 percent of
   voters in support of the new deal, and after a three-day strike and the
   threat of a second strike.

   ** Columbia University has not yet reached an initial agreement with its
   union. The NLRB election was held in December 2016; the NLRB issued its
   decision certifying the union on December 16, 2017. Negotiations for a
   first contract started in February 2019 and a tentative agreement was
   reached in April 2021 but was voted down by union members. In July 2021,
   union members elected a new union bargaining committee after all 10
   members of the union***s bargaining committee stepped down. In September
   2021, union members authorized a strike and on November 3, 2021, the
   strike commenced.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   UE CLAIM: As a democratic union, all graduate students will decide
   together what to include in a contract.

   FACT CHECK: If the UE prevails in an election, it would represent a large
   body, so it is highly unlikely that every student member will have a say
   during collective bargaining.

   We don***t know exactly how the UE will conduct its business, but in many
   negotiation settings, decisions about what to do at the bargaining table,
   including what proposals to make or drop, what employer proposals to
   accept, and what to counter-propose, will likely be made by the bargaining
   team, perhaps with an advisory body of members consulting. The bargaining
   team at Harvard, for example, has consisted of about a dozen students
   representing a unit of some 4,500 students.**

   The final tentative agreement that may be reached will likely be voted on
   by the entire union membership, but that means only those individuals in
   the bargaining unit who have decided to actually join the union and pay
   dues.**At Harvard, for example, we understand that union members currently
   constitute about 33 percent of the entire bargaining unit.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   UE CLAIM: The UE will make things better for all MIT graduate students,
   and stipends will never decrease with a union.

   FACT CHECK: The law requires parties to negotiate in good faith on
   mandatory subjects of bargaining, but neither side is required to make a
   particular concession, or agree to a particular proposal. No one can
   guarantee what a final collective bargaining agreement will contain.
   Bargaining does not necessarily begin with the status quo, and MIT, like
   the union, would have the authority to propose changes to the status quo.
   The outcome of such negotiations simply cannot be known in advance.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   UE CLAIM: A contract will not prevent a student from working more than the
   work-hour limits agreed to by the UE and MIT.

   FACT CHECK: We do not know what a workload article in a future collective
   bargaining agreement will look like, or what restrictions may be placed on
   work hours and assignments.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.**

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the story.
   MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions, discuss
   issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate information.

     MIT urges every eligible graduate student to cast an informed vote on
                                  unionization

   In the coming weeks, MIT graduate students may be asked to participate in
   a highly consequential election, voting on whether or not to form a union
   represented by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America
   (UE).

   MIT***s leaders respect the right of graduate students to review their
   options and to make their own decisions about whether unionization and
   affiliation with the UE is in their best interest, in pursuit of their
   education.

   We do not believe, however, that unionization is the most constructive
   path forward for our graduate students, as it could replace the
   Institute***s current collaborative approach with a more confrontational
   model.

   MIT***s leaders are proud of the Institute***s recent progress on behalf
   of our graduate students *** achieved through direct and positive
   collaboration with graduate student leaders.

   Moreover, MIT remains committed to preparing its graduate students to
   serve as the next generation of contributors in a range of domains:
   Today***s students will lead tomorrow***s creation and application of new
   knowledge in the service of a better world.**

  While voting is not mandatory, it is important that every eligible graduate
  student vote, as the decision to elect a graduate student union could impact
  the relationship between MIT and its graduate students for decades to come:

     o The outcome of a union election is determined by a simple majority of
       eligible voters who actually vote, not by a majority of those who are
       eligible to vote.
     o If approved, representation by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine
       Workers of America (UE) would be binding on both voting and non-voting
       graduate students in the bargaining unit, with the Institute required
       to recognize the UE as the bargaining representative for all graduate
       students within the certified bargaining unit.
     o If a union is elected, that decision could have a [15]lasting effect
       on both current and future MIT graduate students. In most cases, this
       is a decision that is made only once: Unions do not stand for
       re-election, and members do not get to vote regularly on whether to
       keep a union. Rather, once a union is in place, it generally stays in
       place, except in very rare cases. While union decertification is
       possible, it is seldom used in practice, and would require a future
       decertification process initiated by bargaining unit members.

  Because of the significance of this decision, it is also important that every
  graduate student take the time to develop a thorough understanding of what
  union representation might and might not accomplish for students at MIT ***
  and recognize how our graduate students have benefited from MIT***s ongoing
  collaboration in addressing student needs over the years:

     o Limits of collective bargaining: Employers and unions are required by
       federal law to bargain collectively only over ***wages, hours, and
       other terms and conditions of employment.*** Other issues of
       importance to many students *** such as local housing costs and
       participation in most Institute decision-making *** are outside the
       scope of required collective bargaining negotiations.
     o Unclear union dues structure: It remains unclear how the UE would
       structure its dues for MIT graduate students. But based on the UE***s
       charges to employees they represent at other organizations, some union
       members at MIT might expect to pay an estimated $550 in annual dues to
       the UE. Whether or not bargaining unit members would be required to
       join the union as a condition of employment would be a matter for
       negotiations between MIT and the union, but even if it is not a
       requirement, all major decisions on contract ratification, strikes,
       and other matters are likely to be decided upon only by paying union
       members.
     o No guarantee of success: Despite this expense, and the [16]possibility
       of strikes, there is no guarantee that stipends, benefits, work hours,
       or other matters related to employment would improve as a result of
       collective bargaining.
     o Stalled negotiations and strikes elsewhere: In all cases involving
       graduate student unions at private universities, [17]more than a year
       elapsed between a successful unionization vote and arrival at a
       ratified first contract. At Harvard, it took over two years from the
       date of the union certification until a first contract was reached. At
       Columbia University, it took more than four years of contentious
       negotiations and multiple extended strikes for the graduate student
       union to reach its current tentative agreement.
     o MIT***s continued collaboration: In contrast to these stalled efforts,
       MIT has continued to work productively and collaboratively with
       graduate students *** even throughout the pandemic *** to understand
       and respond to their needs and priorities.
     o MIT is already a leader on stipends:  MIT***s minimum graduate student
       stipend, and its 6.25 percent increase to stipends this year, already
       compare favorably to *** and in most cases, are substantially more
       generous than *** the comparable amounts achieved by unions at the
       nine private American universities with unionized graduate students.
     o Reduced role of GSC and other existing graduate student groups: If the
       UE wins the election, MIT would no longer be able to work with the
       Graduate Student Council (GSC) or any other graduate student group on
       matters such as compensation and working conditions for students in
       the certified unit. The union would become the exclusive bargaining
       agent on such matters, and it would be illegal for MIT to deal with
       the GSC or another graduate student group on any matters affecting
       wages, hours or working conditions for bargaining unit members.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.**

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the story.
   MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions, discuss
   issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate information.

    2. How the current student-administration collaboration and successes
       compare to institutions with graduate student unions

 How the current student-administration collaboration and successes compare to
                   institutions with graduate student unions

   MIT is proud of the accomplishments we have achieved in direct and
   collaborative partnership with graduate student leaders.

   It is worth noting that MIT***s approach to governance is unique, as
   almost all standing faculty committees include student participation. In
   the words of a past chair of the faculty, ***Students not only bring their
   fresh eyes and perspectives to bear on agenda items, but their presence
   signals the inclusive nature of our governance system *** with all its
   shared responsibilities.*****

   A strong example of student-administration collaboration rests with the
   Graduate Student Council (GSC). GSC representatives typically meet several
   times a month with MIT administrative leaders, and as needed (often
   weekly) to address more urgent issues *** such as Covid-19, evolving
   policies that may impact international students, and campus culture. This
   ongoing partnership allows the Institute to work quickly to address
   emerging needs *** a degree of responsiveness that would be difficult to
   match if the relationship between MIT and its graduate students were
   governed by a long-term contract.

   Further, the GSC plays an essential role in the yearly process of setting
   graduate student stipends and benefits, providing a cost-of-living
   analysis that is instrumental in determining levels. The GSC also has been
   active in improving and shaping the graduate student residential
   experience through the [15]Graduate Housing Working Group, which has five
   student members.

   In short, our graduate students have had a voice and a seat at the table,
   and would continue to have such a role without a union.

As a result of this strong working relationship, here is what we have achieved
together:

   On graduate student stipends, MIT already compares favorably to the nine
   private American universities that have graduate student unions: American
   University, Brandeis University, Brown University, Columbia University (no
   ratified contract as of yet), Georgetown University, Harvard University,
   The New School, New York University, and Tufts University.

   MIT, with a higher minimum stipend for graduate students than eight of
   these nine unionized institutions, voluntarily granted graduate students a
   6.25 percent increase in compensation this year: This summer, the
   Institute [16]increased its stipend ranges for 2021-22 by 3.25 percent,
   exceeding the GSC***s Stipend Working Group estimate of the change in
   cost-of-living by more than 1 percent. This increase was the product of
   MIT***s longstanding student-led annual stipend process, which allows
   stipends to be set every year based on economic circumstances. The
   Institute then included graduate students in the special 3 percent pay
   increase given to most employees this fall, following the MIT
   endowment***s recent strong performance.

   This 6.25 percent increase is more than students have received this year
   at eight of the nine private universities that have a graduate student
   union. Even at Harvard and Columbia *** each of which experienced strikes
   in recent months, during the negotiation of their current agreements ***
   stipends will increase only by 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, in
   the current fiscal year; Columbia***s 7 percent increase followed four
   years of negotiations and a disruptive 65-day strike by graduate students.
   Most of the other unionized universities have increased their graduate
   student stipends by just 2 to 3 percent this year.

   MIT provides its graduate students with [17]comprehensive health insurance
   whose premiums compare very favorably to those at our peer institutions.
   Rates for individual students, or for students and their partners, are
   [18]on par with or less expensive than those at peers such as Brown, Yale,
   Harvard, Dartmouth, and Stanford. Further, MIT***s rates for plans
   including spouses and children are significantly lower than those peers
   *** often by half *** and family plans are nearly two-thirds less
   expensive. **Students also have multiple other insurance options available
   to them. For graduate students who encounter financial hardship ***
   whether due to medical or other expenses *** MIT offers many types of
   [19]emergency financial assistance. Finally, MIT Medical is always
   available to hear students*** concerns directly, and student leaders and
   student groups are actively engaged in assessing and improving student
   coverage options.

   MIT***s Office of Graduate Education has also [20]enhanced available
   financial assistance and grants, including by increasing its commitment to
   the need-blind Grants for Graduate Students with Children program, raising
   award levels from $2,000-$4,000 to $5,000-$7,000. See more information
   about MIT***s various types of [21]financial support for graduate
   students.

   MIT***s other collaborative work with graduate students has led to
   commitments that address concerns about [22]our campus climate and
   culture. These commitments include, for example, additional resources and
   hiring within the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office,
   as well as the first phase of [23]guaranteed transitional funding for
   graduate students who change research groups or advisors, including cases
   where the student leaves because of allegations of harassment and
   discrimination. MIT also continues to work to address many of the issues
   being raised by graduate students in support of [24]action on diversity,
   equity, and inclusion. We are committed to continuing our direct and
   collaborative work with all of our graduate students on these and other
   important issues.

   Finally, MIT has championed its international students: To help manage the
   challenges that the pandemic and other recent events have presented for
   its international graduate students, MIT allocated $5.8 million, and
   significant administrative resources, to facilitate roughly 1,300 remote
   appointments. In 2020, together with Harvard University, MIT successfully
   [25]filed suit against ICE and the US Department of Homeland Security to
   prevent enforcement of a policy that would have barred international
   students on F-1 visas from taking a full online course load while studying
   in the United States.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.**

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the story.
   MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions, discuss
   issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate information.

    2. Recent gains for MIT graduate students

                     Recent gains for MIT graduate students

   MIT recognizes that its 7,000 graduate students are one of the most
   talented scholarly cohorts in the world. The Institute strongly encourages
   all graduate students to learn more about the gains and successes that
   have resulted from its collaborative approach to student-Institute
   processes and partnerships.

   Many of MIT***s collaborative efforts with student leaders over the past
   few years have been focused on helping graduate students who have faced
   acute financial and personal challenges. This approach has been advocated
   by the Institute***s student community, is in keeping with MIT***s spirit
   and values, and informs MIT***s work to create a more caring and
   supportive environment for everyone.

   Graduate Student Council (GSC) representatives typically meet several
   times a month with MIT administrative leaders, and as needed to address
   more urgent issues *** such as Covid-19, evolving policies that may impact
   international students, and campus culture. Further, the GSC plays an
   essential role in the yearly process of setting graduate student stipends
   and benefits, and has been active in improving and shaping the graduate
   student residential experience through the**[15]Graduate Housing Working
   Group,**which has five student members. This ongoing partnership allows
   the Institute to work quickly to address emerging needs *** a degree of
   responsiveness that would be difficult to match if the relationship
   between MIT and its graduate students were governed by a long-term
   contract.

   Over the past five years, the MIT-student collaboration has led to
   numerous accomplishments, including:

     o Greater financial security for all students: MIT***s
       cost-of-living-based stipend increases have outpaced those of our
       peers, and those of private universities with graduate student unions.
       With the proceeds from its recent strong endowment returns, MIT has
       invested in all members of the community, including graduate students.
     o In response to student requests, MIT has invested in students with the
       most pressing needs: The Institute has established new programs and
       staffing, and has allocated approximately $1 million in grants for
       graduate students with families, students on short-term appointments,
       and doctoral students needing longer-term support.
     o MIT has provided enhanced health and wellness support: It has added
       more support professionals and virtual visits. MIT Medical continues
       to offer excellent, low-cost, robust [16]health insurance options, and
       has expanded access to behavioral health care.
     o MIT has championed its international students: To help manage the
       challenges that the pandemic and other recent events have presented
       for its international graduate students, MIT allocated $5.8 million,
       and significant administrative resources, to facilitate roughly 1,300
       remote appointments. In 2020, together with Harvard University, MIT
       successfully [17]filed suit against ICE and the US Department of
       Homeland Security to prevent enforcement of a policy that would have
       barred international students on F-1 visas from taking a full online
       course load while studying in the United States.
     o MIT has worked to build a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse
       community: It has hired school-based diversity deans, and fought for
       and won enhanced protections for international students.**
     o MIT has expanded the support networks for graduate students**and is
       combatting harassment in academia: It has invested [18]additional
       resources in its Violence Prevention and Response and Institute
       Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR) offices; refined
       [19]anti-retaliation policies; provided [20]guaranteed transitional
       funding for students who switch labs or advisors;**and offered
       additional [21]mentoring and harassment prevention training.
       Additionally, IDHR is now a central hub for [22]reporting
       discriminatory treatment and [23]publishes an annual report detailing
       the nature of discrimination, bias, and harassment cases handled by
       IDHR involving students, faculty, and staff.
     o MIT has responded effectively to the challenges of the pandemic. The
       Institute kept our community safe, while allowing mission-critical
       teaching and research to continue. Throughout the pandemic, MIT
       offered its students generous assistance with housing costs, moving
       expenses, and other financial burdens associated with Covid-19.
     o MIT has fostered the personal and professional growth of its students:
       It has enhanced advising and training, offered more than 40 workshops
       and panels through partnerships with 15 academic and administrative
       departments, and developed more focused career fairs and networking
       opportunities. New staff have been added within Career Advising and
       Professional Development and the Office of Graduate Education to
       support graduate students.

   The Institute is proud of what its graduate students, faculty, and staff
   have accomplished together in recent years to enhance the graduate student
   experience. The following ongoing efforts will build on the above gains

     MIT urges every eligible graduate student to cast an informed vote on
                                  unionization

   In the coming weeks, MIT graduate students may be asked to participate in
   a highly consequential election, voting on whether or not to form a union
   represented by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America
   (UE).

   MIT***s leaders respect the right of graduate students to review their
   options and to make their own decisions about whether unionization and
   affiliation with the UE is in their best interest, in pursuit of their
   education.

   We do not believe, however, that unionization is the most constructive
   path forward for our graduate students, as it could replace the
   Institute***s current collaborative approach with a more confrontational
   model.

   MIT***s leaders are proud of the Institute***s recent progress on behalf
   of our graduate students *** achieved through direct and positive
   collaboration with graduate student leaders.

   Moreover, MIT remains committed to preparing its graduate students to
   serve as the next generation of contributors in a range of domains:
   Today***s students will lead tomorrow***s creation and application of new
   knowledge in the service of a better world.**

  While voting is not mandatory, it is important that every eligible graduate
  student vote, as the decision to elect a graduate student union could impact
  the relationship between MIT and its graduate students for decades to come:

     o The outcome of a union election is determined by a simple majority of
       eligible voters who actually vote, not by a majority of those who are
       eligible to vote.
     o If approved, representation by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine
       Workers of America (UE) would be binding on both voting and non-voting
       graduate students in the bargaining unit, with the Institute required
       to recognize the UE as the bargaining representative for all graduate
       students within the certified bargaining unit.
     o If a union is elected, that decision could have a [15]lasting effect
       on both current and future MIT graduate students. In most cases, this
       is a decision that is made only once: Unions do not stand for
       re-election, and members do not get to vote regularly on whether to
       keep a union. Rather, once a union is in place, it generally stays in
       place, except in very rare cases. While union decertification is
       possible, it is seldom used in practice, and would require a future
       decertification process initiated by bargaining unit members.

  Because of the significance of this decision, it is also important that every
  graduate student take the time to develop a thorough understanding of what
  union representation might and might not accomplish for students at MIT ***
  and recognize how our graduate students have benefited from MIT***s ongoing
  collaboration in addressing student needs over the years:

     o Limits of collective bargaining: Employers and unions are required by
       federal law to bargain collectively only over ***wages, hours, and
       other terms and conditions of employment.*** Other issues of
       importance to many students *** such as local housing costs and
       participation in most Institute decision-making *** are outside the
       scope of required collective bargaining negotiations.
     o Unclear union dues structure: It remains unclear how the UE would
       structure its dues for MIT graduate students. But based on the UE***s
       charges to employees they represent at other organizations, some union
       members at MIT might expect to pay an estimated $550 in annual dues to
       the UE. Whether or not bargaining unit members would be required to
       join the union as a condition of employment would be a matter for
       negotiations between MIT and the union, but even if it is not a
       requirement, all major decisions on contract ratification, strikes,
       and other matters are likely to be decided upon only by paying union
       members.
     o No guarantee of success: Despite this expense, and the [16]possibility
       of strikes, there is no guarantee that stipends, benefits, work hours,
       or other matters related to employment would improve as a result of
       collective bargaining.
     o Stalled negotiations and strikes elsewhere: In all cases involving
       graduate student unions at private universities, [17]more than a year
       elapsed between a successful unionization vote and arrival at a
       ratified first contract. At Harvard, it took over two years from the
       date of the union certification until a first contract was reached. At
       Columbia University, it took more than four years of contentious
       negotiations and multiple extended strikes for the graduate student
       union to reach its current tentative agreement.
     o MIT***s continued collaboration: In contrast to these stalled efforts,
       MIT has continued to work productively and collaboratively with
       graduate students *** even throughout the pandemic *** to understand
       and respond to their needs and priorities.
     o MIT is already a leader on stipends:  MIT***s minimum graduate student
       stipend, and its 6.25 percent increase to stipends this year, already
       compare favorably to *** and in most cases, are substantially more
       generous than *** the comparable amounts achieved by unions at the
       nine private American universities with unionized graduate students.
     o Reduced role of GSC and other existing graduate student groups: If the
       UE wins the election, MIT would no longer be able to work with the
       Graduate Student Council (GSC) or any other graduate student group on
       matters such as compensation and working conditions for students in
       the certified unit. The union would become the exclusive bargaining
       agent on such matters, and it would be illegal for MIT to deal with
       the GSC or another graduate student group on any matters affecting
       wages, hours or working conditions for bargaining unit members.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.**

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the story.
   MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions, discuss
   issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate information.
