Casting an informed vote on graduate student unionization

   February 01, 2022

Highlights

     * MIT has declined a request to recognize a graduate student union
       without an election: "All eligible students should have the chance
       to choose for themselves."
     * Institute senior leaders do not believe a graduate student union
       will produce better, or quicker, outcomes for students: "Promises
       about what collective bargaining can deliver have been overstated."
     * At MIT, we solve problems best together, and our longstanding model
       for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic, and
       effective.
     * All graduate students should cast an informed vote after
       considering both sides in this debate and visiting

     __________________________________________________________________

   To MIT graduate students,

   As you have likely heard, some MIT graduate students are seeking to
   form a union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine
   Workers of America (UE). Union organizers have now filed a petition
   with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), requesting an election
   to determine if eligible graduate students will be represented by a
   union.

   Last month, the Institute declined the UE's request to recognize such a
   union without an election. MIT's senior leaders believe that all
   eligible students should have the chance to choose for themselves,
   through an independent election, whether unionization is in their best
   interests.

   In recent months, the UE has shared its views via social media, press
   releases, and op-eds -- but no one can make an informed choice having
   heard only one side. We write to you now to share MIT's senior leaders'
   perspective on graduate student unionization; highlight what's at stake
   in this election; and to convey why, when the time comes, it's critical
   that you vote.

Making an informed choice

   Here are a few of the most important reasons why we believe that MIT's
   longstanding partnership with graduate students is a better path
   forward than unionization:
     * As students attending MIT to learn and to earn a graduate degree,
       your connection to the Institute is broader than an
       employee/employer relationship. But beyond wages, benefits, hours,
       and other straightforward terms and conditions of employment, there
       are many issues that collective bargaining is not well-suited to
       resolve.
       Unfortunately, promises about what collective bargaining can
       deliver have been overstated and the burdens you could face if the
       union is successful have been understated: a bureaucratic, lengthy
       labor bargaining process; the potential cost of dues; and the
       detrimental effect that strikes and other disruptions may have on
       your learning and research.
       At MIT, we solve problems best together, and [9]our longstanding
       model for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic,
       and effective. Your seat at the table is established and secure,
       and [10]yields real results -- on issues including stipends,
       student support, medical benefits, immigration matters,
       transitional funding, and fostering a more inclusive, supportive,
       and diverse community.
       This existing structure serves all graduate students, and reflects
       the fact that your connections with MIT are nuanced, varied, and in
       most cases, exceptionally rewarding. It also provides more
       flexibility than a union could in responding to graduate students'
       varied needs across an institution as diverse as ours.

     * Finally, once installed, labor unions are essentially permanent.
       Unions do not stand for re-election. This is not an experiment:
       When you cast your vote, you are making a choice not only on behalf
       of current students, but also the many thousands of graduate
       students who will succeed you over the decades.


Building a better MIT together

   Like every institution, MIT will always have room for improvement.
   Those of us who have devoted our lives to MIT, and to making it a place
   of excellence and belonging for generations of our students, are deeply
   aware that we must always strive to do better.

   While we acknowledge that there is always more to be done, we are proud
   of the significant progress we have made in recent years, thanks to our
   collaboration with graduate student leaders. We have serious concerns
   that a graduate student union aligned with the UE will not be able to
   build on these successes and produce better outcomes for you.

   Those of us who lead MIT are personally invested in your success -- and
   having been graduate students ourselves, we understand the challenges
   you face. No matter the election outcome, we will continue to work
   alongside you both to help you succeed academically and to make MIT
   better for all of our students.

   We will have more to say in the coming weeks, and we will share details
   about how you can vote once the NLRB has set the election. As a
   starting point, though, we encourage you to visit
   [11]grad-union.mit.edu, and to discuss this very important decision
   with your fellow students. There is much for you to consider, and a lot
   is riding on your decision.

Important update on graduate student unionization

   February 01, 2022

   To the members of the MIT community,

   We write to update you on efforts by a group of MIT graduate students
   to form a union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and
   Machine Workers of America (UE).

   Please see below a letter we sent earlier today to our graduate
   students, sharing the news that all eligible graduate students will be
   given the opportunity to decide on unionization through an independent
   election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. This is the
   latest step in a process set in motion last September, when the union
   organizers publicly launched their campaign.

   We respect the right of graduate students to review their options and
   to make their own decisions about whether unionization and affiliation
   with the UE is in their best interest.

   However, we do not believe that unionization is the most constructive
   path forward for our graduate students. Today's letter to graduate
   students explains that position. For those who are interested in
   learning more, we invite you to visit [8]grad-union.mit.edu, created to
   help every graduate student cast an informed vote on this important
   issue.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

    2. How the current student-administration collaboration and successes
       compare to institutions with graduate student unions

How the current student-administration collaboration and successes compare to
institutions with graduate student unions

   MIT is proud of the accomplishments we have achieved in direct and
   collaborative partnership with graduate student leaders.

   It is worth noting that MIT's approach to governance is unique, as
   almost all standing faculty committees include student participation.
   In the words of a past chair of the faculty, "Students not only bring
   their fresh eyes and perspectives to bear on agenda items, but their
   presence signals the inclusive nature of our governance system -- with
   all its shared responsibilities."

   A strong example of student-administration collaboration rests with the
   Graduate Student Council (GSC). GSC representatives typically meet
   several times a month with MIT administrative leaders, and as needed
   (often weekly) to address more urgent issues -- such as Covid-19,
   evolving policies that may impact international students, and campus
   culture. This ongoing partnership allows the Institute to work quickly
   to address emerging needs -- a degree of responsiveness that would be
   difficult to match if the relationship between MIT and its graduate
   students were governed by a long-term contract.

   Further, the GSC plays an essential role in the yearly process of
   setting graduate student stipends and benefits, providing a
   cost-of-living analysis that is instrumental in determining levels. The
   GSC also has been active in improving and shaping the graduate student
   residential experience through the [14]Graduate Housing Working Group,
   which has five student members.

   In short, our graduate students have had a voice and a seat at the
   table, and would continue to have such a role without a union.

As a result of this strong working relationship, here is what we have
achieved together:

   On graduate student stipends, MIT already compares favorably to the
   nine private American universities that have graduate student unions:
   American University, Brandeis University, Brown University, Columbia
   University (no ratified contract as of yet), Georgetown University,
   Harvard University, The New School, New York University, and Tufts
   University.

   MIT, with a higher minimum stipend for graduate students than eight of
   these nine unionized institutions, voluntarily granted graduate
   students a 6.25 percent increase in compensation this year: This
   summer, the Institute [15]increased its stipend ranges for 2021-22 by
   3.25 percent, exceeding the GSC's Stipend Working Group estimate of the
   change in cost-of-living by more than 1 percent. This increase was the
   product of MIT's longstanding student-led annual stipend process, which
   allows stipends to be set every year based on economic circumstances.
   The Institute then included graduate students in the special 3 percent
   pay increase given to most employees this fall, following the MIT
   endowment's recent strong performance.

   This 6.25 percent increase is more than students have received this
   year at eight of the nine private universities that have a graduate
   student union. Even at Harvard and Columbia -- each of which
   experienced strikes in recent months, during the negotiation of their
   current agreements -- stipends will increase only by 5 percent and 7
   percent, respectively, in the current fiscal year; Columbia's 7 percent
   increase followed four years of negotiations and a disruptive 65-day
   strike by graduate students. Most of the other unionized universities
   have increased their graduate student stipends by just 2 to 3 percent
   this year.
   MIT provides its graduate students with [16]comprehensive health
   insurance whose premiums compare very favorably to those at our peer
   institutions. Rates for individual students, or for students and their
   partners, are [17]on par with or less expensive than those at peers
   such as Brown, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Stanford. Further, MIT's
   rates for plans including spouses and children are significantly lower
   than those peers -- often by half -- and family plans are nearly
   two-thirds less expensive.  Students also have multiple other insurance
   options available to them. For graduate students who encounter
   financial hardship -- whether due to medical or other expenses -- MIT
   offers many types of [18]emergency financial assistance. Finally, MIT
   Medical is always available to hear students' concerns directly, and
   student leaders and student groups are actively engaged in assessing
   and improving student coverage options.

   MIT's Office of Graduate Education has also [19]enhanced available
   financial assistance and grants, including by increasing its commitment
   to the need-blind Grants for Graduate Students with Children program,
   raising award levels from $2,000-$4,000 to $5,000-$7,000. See more
   information about MIT's various types of [20]financial support for
   graduate students.

   MIT's other collaborative work with graduate students has led to
   commitments that address concerns about [21]our campus climate and
   culture. These commitments include, for example, additional resources
   and hiring within the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response
   Office, as well as the first phase of [22]guaranteed transitional
   funding for graduate students who change research groups or advisors,
   including cases where the student leaves because of allegations of
   harassment and discrimination. MIT also continues to work to address
   many of the issues being raised by graduate students in support of
   [23]action on diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are committed to
   continuing our direct and collaborative work with all of our graduate
   students on these and other important issues.
   Finally, MIT has championed its international students: To help manage
   the challenges that the pandemic and other recent events have presented
   for its international graduate students, MIT allocated $5.8 million,
   and significant administrative resources, to facilitate roughly 1,300
   remote appointments. In 2020, together with Harvard University, MIT
   successfully [24]filed suit against ICE and the US Department of
   Homeland Security to prevent enforcement of a policy that would have
   barred international students on F-1 visas from taking a full online
   course load while studying in the United States.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the
   story. MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions,
   discuss issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate
   information.

Recent gains for MIT graduate students

   MIT recognizes that its 7,000 graduate students are one of the most
   talented scholarly cohorts in the world. The Institute strongly
   encourages all graduate students to learn more about the gains and
   successes that have resulted from its collaborative approach to
   student-Institute processes and partnerships.
   Many of MIT's collaborative efforts with student leaders over the past
   few years have been focused on helping graduate students who have faced
   acute financial and personal challenges. This approach has been
   advocated by the Institute's student community, is in keeping with
   MIT's spirit and values, and informs MIT's work to create a more caring
   and supportive environment for everyone.
   Graduate Student Council (GSC) representatives typically meet several
   times a month with MIT administrative leaders, and as needed to address
   more urgent issues -- such as Covid-19, evolving policies that may
   impact international students, and campus culture. Further, the GSC
   plays an essential role in the yearly process of setting graduate
   student stipends and benefits, and has been active in improving and
   shaping the graduate student residential experience through
   the [14]Graduate Housing Working Group, which has five student members.
   This ongoing partnership allows the Institute to work quickly to
   address emerging needs -- a degree of responsiveness that would be
   difficult to match if the relationship between MIT and its graduate
   students were governed by a long-term contract.

   Over the past five years, the MIT-student collaboration has led to
   numerous accomplishments, including:
     * Greater financial security for all students: MIT's
       cost-of-living-based stipend increases have outpaced those of our
       peers, and those of private universities with graduate student
       unions. With the proceeds from its recent strong endowment returns,
       MIT has invested in all members of the community, including
       graduate students.
     * In response to student requests, MIT has invested in students with
       the most pressing needs: The Institute has established new programs
       and staffing, and has allocated approximately $1 million in grants
       for graduate students with families, students on short-term
       appointments, and doctoral students needing longer-term support.
     * MIT has provided enhanced health and wellness support: It has added
       more support professionals and virtual visits. MIT Medical
       continues to offer excellent, low-cost, robust [15]health insurance
       options, and has expanded access to behavioral health care.
     * MIT has championed its international students: To help manage the
       challenges that the pandemic and other recent events have presented
       for its international graduate students, MIT allocated $5.8
       million, and significant administrative resources, to facilitate
       roughly 1,300 remote appointments. In 2020, together with Harvard
       University, MIT successfully [16]filed suit against ICE and the US
       Department of Homeland Security to prevent enforcement of a policy
       that would have barred international students on F-1 visas from
       taking a full online course load while studying in the United
       States.
     * MIT has worked to build a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse
       community: It has hired school-based diversity deans, and fought
       for and won enhanced protections for international students.
     * MIT has expanded the support networks for graduate students and is
       combatting harassment in academia: It has invested [17]additional
       resources in its Violence Prevention and Response and Institute
       Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR) offices; refined
       [18]anti-retaliation policies; provided [19]guaranteed transitional
       funding for students who switch labs or advisors; and offered
       additional [20]mentoring and harassment prevention training.
       Additionally, IDHR is now a central hub for [21]reporting
       discriminatory treatment and [22]publishes an annual report
       detailing the nature of discrimination, bias, and harassment cases
       handled by IDHR involving students, faculty, and staff.
     * MIT has responded effectively to the challenges of the pandemic.
       The Institute kept our community safe, while allowing
       mission-critical teaching and research to continue. Throughout the
       pandemic, MIT offered its students generous assistance with housing
       costs, moving expenses, and other financial burdens associated with
       Covid-19.
     * MIT has fostered the personal and professional growth of its
       students: It has enhanced advising and training, offered more than
       40 workshops and panels through partnerships with 15 academic and
       administrative departments, and developed more focused career fairs
       and networking opportunities. New staff have been added within
       Career Advising and Professional Development and the Office of
       Graduate Education to support graduate students.

   The Institute is proud of what its graduate students, faculty, and
   staff have accomplished together in recent years to enhance the
   graduate student experience. The following ongoing efforts will build
   on the above gains that have already been made together:
     * MIT's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Strategic Action Plan,
       which is on track to be released and implemented beginning in
       spring 2022;
     * recommendations for improvements focused on campus safety and
       policing, phase two of the guaranteed transitional support program,
       and advising and mentoring, which are all scheduled to be issued
       and considered by the MIT administration in the spring semester;
       and
     * existing work to increase financial support for MIT's 7,000
       graduate students, improve student life by continuing to modernize
       campus facilities, and strengthen classroom and digital learning
       experiences.

   Additional information is available on the [23]Office of the Vice
   Chancellor website.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the
   story. MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions,
   discuss issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate
   information.

MIT urges every eligible graduate student to cast an informed vote on
unionization

   In the coming weeks, MIT graduate students may be asked to participate
   in a highly consequential election, voting on whether or not to form a
   union represented by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of
   America (UE).
   MIT's leaders respect the right of graduate students to review their
   options and to make their own decisions about whether unionization and
   affiliation with the UE is in their best interest, in pursuit of their
   education.
   We do not believe, however, that unionization is the most constructive
   path forward for our graduate students, as it could replace the
   Institute's current collaborative approach with a more confrontational
   model.
   MIT's leaders are proud of the Institute's recent progress on behalf of
   our graduate students -- achieved through direct and positive
   collaboration with graduate student leaders.
   Moreover, MIT remains committed to preparing its graduate students to
   serve as the next generation of contributors in a range of domains:
   Today's students will lead tomorrow's creation and application of new
   knowledge in the service of a better world.

While voting is not mandatory, it is important that every eligible graduate
student vote, as the decision to elect a graduate student union could impact
the relationship between MIT and its graduate students for decades to come:

     * The outcome of a union election is determined by a simple majority
       of eligible voters who actually vote, not by a majority of those
       who are eligible to vote.
     * If approved, representation by the United Electrical, Radio &
       Machine Workers of America (UE) would be binding on both voting and
       non-voting graduate students in the bargaining unit, with the
       Institute required to recognize the UE as the bargaining
       representative for all graduate students within the certified
       bargaining unit.
     * If a union is elected, that decision could have a [13]lasting
       effect on both current and future MIT graduate students. In most
       cases, this is a decision that is made only once: Unions do not
       stand for re-election, and members do not get to vote regularly on
       whether to keep a union. Rather, once a union is in place, it
       generally stays in place, except in very rare cases. While union
       decertification is possible, it is seldom used in practice, and
       would require a future decertification process initiated by
       bargaining unit members.

Because of the significance of this decision, it is also important that every
graduate student take the time to develop a thorough understanding of what
union representation might and might not accomplish for students at MIT --
and recognize how our graduate students have benefited from MIT's ongoing
collaboration in addressing student needs over the years:

     * Limits of collective bargaining: Employers and unions are required
       by federal law to bargain collectively only over "wages, hours, and
       other terms and conditions of employment." Other issues of
       importance to many students -- such as local housing costs and
       participation in most Institute decision-making -- are outside the
       scope of required collective bargaining negotiations.
     * Unclear union dues structure: It remains unclear how the UE would
       structure its dues for MIT graduate students. But based on the UE's
       charges to employees they represent at other organizations, some
       union members at MIT might expect to pay an estimated $550 in
       annual dues to the UE. Whether or not bargaining unit members would
       be required to join the union as a condition of employment would be
       a matter for negotiations between MIT and the union, but even if it
       is not a requirement, all major decisions on contract ratification,
       strikes, and other matters are likely to be decided upon only by
       paying union members.
     * No guarantee of success: Despite this expense, and the
       [14]possibility of strikes, there is no guarantee that stipends,
       benefits, work hours, or other matters related to employment would
       improve as a result of collective bargaining.
     * Stalled negotiations and strikes elsewhere: In all cases involving
       graduate student unions at private universities, [15]more than a
       year elapsed between a successful unionization vote and arrival at
       a ratified first contract. At Harvard, it took over two years from
       the date of the union certification until a first contract was
       reached. At Columbia University, it took more than four years of
       contentious negotiations and multiple extended strikes for the
       graduate student union to reach its current tentative agreement.
     * MIT's continued collaboration: In contrast to these stalled
       efforts, MIT has continued to work productively and collaboratively
       with graduate students -- even throughout the pandemic -- to
       understand and respond to their needs and priorities.
     * MIT is already a leader on stipends: MIT's minimum graduate student
       stipend, and its 6.25 percent increase to stipends this year,
       already compare favorably to -- and in most cases, are
       substantially more generous than -- the comparable amounts achieved
       by unions at the nine private American universities with unionized
       graduate students.
     * Reduced role of GSC and other existing graduate student groups: If
       the UE wins the election, MIT would no longer be able to work with
       the Graduate Student Council (GSC) or any other graduate student
       group on matters such as compensation and working conditions for
       students in the certified unit. The union would become the
       exclusive bargaining agent on such matters, and it would be illegal
       for MIT to deal with the GSC or another graduate student group on
       any matters affecting wages, hours or working conditions for
       bargaining unit members.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the
   story. MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions,
   discuss issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate
   information.

    2. Background on Unions and Unionization

Background on Unions and Unionization

   In September 2021, a group of MIT graduate students affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) announced a
   campaign to unionize MIT's graduate student population. That group, the
   MIT Graduate Students Union, now reports sufficient backing to compel a
   vote, overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, of all graduate
   students within the proposed bargaining unit.
   MIT's leaders respect the right of graduate students review their
   options and to make their own decisions about whether unionization and
   affiliation with the UE is in their best interest, in pursuit of their
   education. Like the students launching this effort, MIT is committed to
   advancing a learning and work environment of mutual respect and care.
   In close collaboration with graduate student leaders, the Institute and
   its schools have taken steps in recent years to invest in our graduate
   students and to foster positive work, learning, and living experiences
   during their time on campus.

Overview of unionization and the UE

     * A union exists for the purpose of dealing with an employer on
       issues related to employee wages, benefits, hours, grievances, and
       other terms of employment. A union that represents a majority of
       employees in what's called "an appropriate bargaining unit," and
       that has been certified by the National Labor Relations Board or
       voluntarily recognized by an employer, serves as the representative
       of that bargaining unit on all such terms and conditions of
       employment.
     * Working with the employer, an elected or recognized union
       negotiates a collective bargaining agreement or contract on behalf
       of the bargaining unit. A union also represents its members when
       disputes arise over the terms of the contract.
     * If the UE wins an election at MIT in an appropriate bargaining
       unit, the Institute will be required to recognize the UE as the
       exclusive bargaining representative of all graduate students in
       that unit. This means that MIT will not be able to work with the
       GSC or any other student organization on matters affecting the
       stipends and working conditions of those in the certified unit.
     * Dues are the cost of membership in a union, and the members of a
       union pay for the costs of negotiating a contract, contract
       administration, and resolution of claims of breaches of contracts.
       Union members' dues also subsidize the organizing of employees at
       other employers, and in some cases, may fund the union's political
       contributions to candidates and causes. Whether or not a union shop
       -- in which everyone in the unit would have to join the union or
       pay dues or fees to it -- would be part of a collective bargaining
       agreement is a matter of negotiations between a union and the
       employer. Most unions propose a form of union shop to ensure a
       regular flow of money, among other reasons.
     * If the union is successful in the upcoming election at MIT, it is
       unclear what the UE's dues structure would ultimately be for MIT
       students. Based on the UE's charges to employees they represent at
       other organizations, some stipended/salaried union members at MIT
       might expect to pay an estimated $550 in annual dues to the UE.
       Whether or not all members of the bargaining unit would have to
       join the union, and/or pay fees to the union, would be a subject of
       negotiations.
     * Even those in the bargaining unit who don't become formal union
       members would still be subject to the terms of the collective
       bargaining contract. First contracts can take a year or longer to
       negotiate, and there is absolutely no guarantee that graduate
       students' stipends, benefits, work hours, or grievance procedures
       would improve as a result of collective bargaining.
     * The law requires good-faith negotiations, but the law does not
       require a particular outcome to that process. That's a matter for
       the two parties at the bargaining table. Experience elsewhere shows
       that some things may improve with a union; but many things do not.
     * There are many graduate student union contracts available online.
       We encourage you to review any of those contracts and to make your
       own judgment about how MIT's graduate students compare to those at
       unionized universities.
     * Finally, if the UE is successful in any upcoming election, the
       presence of a union as the exclusive representative of the graduate
       students in the bargaining unit is not likely to change over time,
       and would not be subject to periodic elections. While there is a
       decertification process, this process is employed very rarely. The
       process requires the employees themselves to obtain signatures from
       30 percent of the bargaining unit, which allows them to file a
       decertification petition with the NLRB and hold an election,
       determined by a majority vote. Decertification petitions are not
       permitted for one year following the union's certification by the
       NLRB. In addition, once a collective bargaining agreement is
       reached, decertification petitions are barred during the first
       three years of the agreement, except during a 30-day "window
       period" that begins 90 days before the contract expiration date.

Facts about collective bargaining

     * The UE and MIT are legally required to engage in good-faith
       bargaining, but the law does not require that any particular
       proposal be put in a union contract, or that either side must make
       any particular concession or agree to any particular proposal. The
       law doesn't guarantee any particular outcome to a round of
       bargaining.
     * Each side is free to reject any particular proposal from the other
       side.
     * Nothing "automatically" goes into a union contract. The fact that
       the UE or other unions have certain provisions in contracts
       elsewhere doesn't guarantee that similar provisions will be
       included in a contract with MIT.
     * During collective bargaining, both MIT and the UE can make
       proposals to change the terms and conditions of employment for
       bargaining unit members.
     * The union can decide on its own methods for picking its
       representatives to serve as bargaining team members and union
       stewards.
     * There is no third party that makes a decision on what goes into an
       agreement if the UE and MIT reach an impasse. A mediator is often
       involved in helping the parties reach an agreement, but the
       mediator cannot force a settlement, or insist on any particular
       proposal.
     * Employees have a right to strike under the law, and are protected
       in that right. Strikes are often called by a union to pressure the
       employer. Strikes among graduate student workers have been quite
       common, such as [14]those at Harvard, Columbia, and New York
       University. While the union may call a strike and direct its
       members not to perform any work for the duration of the strike, MIT
       is not obligated to compensate employees who are on strike, and in
       some situations may be entitled to recoup compensation already
       paid.
     * No one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
     * In collective bargaining, members of a union can end up with more
       than they have now in some areas, the same, or in some areas,
       possibly less. We just don't know -- and neither does the union.

   The experience of graduate student unions at peer institutions can also
   illustrate the limitations of a union in securing particular contract
   provisions. For example, Harvard's Graduate Student Union ratified its
   first contract after 20 months of negotiations and 26 months after the
   union's certification. Its second contract was settled in November
   2021, following a three-day strike, the threat of a second strike, and
   eight months of intense negotiations.

   While the Harvard union did achieve some gains in compensation, health
   care coverage, and legal funding for Title IX and other misconduct
   processes, what was included in the final contract was considerably
   less than the union's stated goals. For example, the union did not
   advance several key priorities, including changes to housing; processes
   for addressing allegations of sexual misconduct, discrimination, and
   academic retaliation; campus policing protocols; mental health care
   policies and procedures; designation of union officers as confidential
   Title IX/sexual misconduct resources; racial justice training for all
   faculty and staff; and staffing in Harvard's student mental health
   office.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the
   story. MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions,
   discuss issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate
   information.

   [14]Casting an informed vote on graduate student unionization (for
   graduate students) - February 1, 2022

   [15]Important update on graduate student unionization (for the MIT
   community) - February 1, 2022

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the
   story. MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions,
   discuss issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate
   information.

    2. Fact-checking UE claims

Fact-checking UE claims

   The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) can
   promise whatever it wants during a unionization campaign, but it cannot
   guarantee that it will be able to back up these promises. It is
   essential that, before voting, all graduate students become fully
   informed about the issues at stake, so that each student can make their
   own determination about what's in their best interest.
   Becoming fully informed requires that each student assess the validity
   of the UE's assertions, and to weigh the potential benefits and costs
   of unionization. What follows is a fact check of some common UE claims:
   UE CLAIM: In addition to improving wages, hours, and other terms and
   conditions of employment, [14]the UE will force MIT to agree to a
   contract "that reflects student priorities, codifies hard-fought wins,
   and ensures that we make progress towards a better MIT."
   FACT CHECK: The truth is that MIT is only required by law to negotiate
   over compensation, hours of work, work duties, layoff and grievance
   procedures, and other terms and conditions of employment. The table
   below describes some of the mandatory and non-mandatory subjects of
   bargaining, as well as illegal subjects of bargaining.
   Some Mandatory Subjects of Bargaining Some Non-Mandatory Subjects of
   Bargaining Some Illegal Subjects of Bargaining**
   Compensation and benefits  MIT's strategic goals, such as diversity,
   equity, and inclusion efforts (although general issues of alleged
   discrimination are bargainable topics)  Changes to rules and
   regulations surrounding immigration that may be in conflict with
   federal law***
   Hours of work Hiring processes Changes to Title IX federal requirements
   Work duties and assignments  Academic issues such as academic
   performance, curriculum components, or course and degree requirements.
   Employment discipline and discharge Housing*
   Grievance procedures Bargaining unit definition
   Recognition clause defining the bargaining unit

   * The NLRB generally does not consider employer housing to be a
   mandatory subject of bargaining if the employee is not forced to live
   in the provided housing. Graduate students may elect to utilize
   Institute housing because of their status as students, not because of
   their status as employees. They are not required to stay in MIT
   housing.
   ** Illegal subjects are those that cannot be legally bargained over by
   either party. They are subjects that would violate a law, and therefore
   cannot be entered into legally in a collective bargaining agreement,
   even if both parties agree to do so.
   *** [15]Federal laws and regulations limit the number of hours certain
   international students can work. Even if MIT and the UE both wanted to
   increase those hours, they would be unable to do so. Similarly, there
   are rules pertaining to international remote work that cannot be
   modified in a MIT-UE contract.

   The experience of graduate student unions at peer institutions can also
   illustrate the limitations of a union in securing particular contract
   provisions. For example, Harvard's Graduate Student Union ratified its
   first contract after 20 months of negotiations and 26 months after the
   union's certification. Its second contract was settled in November
   2021, following a three-day strike, the threat of a second strike, and
   eight months of intense negotiations.

   While the Harvard union did achieve some gains in compensation, health
   care coverage, and legal funding for Title IX and other misconduct
   processes, what was included in the final contract was considerably
   less than the union's stated goals. For example, the union did not
   advance several key priorities, including changes to housing; processes
   for addressing allegations of sexual misconduct, discrimination, and
   academic retaliation; campus policing protocols; mental health care
   policies and procedures; designation of union officers as confidential
   Title IX/sexual misconduct resources; racial justice training for all
   faculty and staff; and staffing in Harvard's student mental health
   office.
     __________________________________________________________________

   UE CLAIM: A union will secure wins for graduate students much more
   quickly than MIT's current committee processes.
   FACT CHECK: The Institute's current annual processes for making
   adjustments and enhancements to [16]graduate student stipends and
   health insurance benefits typically take only a few months. Rates and
   benefits for the upcoming academic year are finalized, approved, and
   announced in April or May. Moreover, MIT's close collaborative
   relationship with its graduate students often enables the Institute to
   move faster in addressing emerging needs than would be possible in
   negotiating a new contract with a union.
   Negotiating a collective bargaining agreement -- and specifically, the
   first agreement between MIT and the UE -- will likely take much longer
   than our current process, meaning students may not know their final
   compensation or benefits for the coming academic year until a contract
   is finalized and ratified through a vote of union members. Some current
   graduate students may graduate before an initial contract is reached
   and ratified.
   It is unclear whether students' compensation and benefits would remain
   at their current levels during the negotiation period, no matter how
   long negotiations take.
   [17]A June 2021 Bloomberg Law analysis estimated that, on average, it
   takes 409 days for new unions and their employers to sign a first
   collective bargaining agreement:
   The table below provides examples of the length of student union
   contract negotiations at other institutions of higher education based
   on available information, and also notes when student-authorized
   strikes have taken place:

   * Negotiations began in October 2018 and ended in June 2020, and
   included a 29-day strike in December 2019. The parties initially agreed
   only to a one-year contract, which expired on June 30, 2021. The
   parties agreed to a second contract, which was ratified in November
   2021, with 70.6 percent of voters in support of the new deal, and after
   a three-day strike and the threat of a second strike.
   ** Columbia University has not yet reached an initial agreement with
   its union. The NLRB election was held in December 2016; the NLRB issued
   its decision certifying the union on December 16, 2017. Negotiations
   for a first contract started in February 2019 and a tentative agreement
   was reached in April 2021 but was voted down by union members. In July
   2021, union members elected a new union bargaining committee after all
   10 members of the union's bargaining committee stepped down. In
   September 2021, union members authorized a strike and on November 3,
   2021, the strike commenced.
     __________________________________________________________________

   UE CLAIM: As a democratic union, all graduate students will decide
   together what to include in a contract.
   FACT CHECK: If the UE prevails in an election, it would represent a
   large body, so it is highly unlikely that every student member will
   have a say during collective bargaining.
   We don't know exactly how the UE will conduct its business, but in many
   negotiation settings, decisions about what to do at the bargaining
   table, including what proposals to make or drop, what employer
   proposals to accept, and what to counter-propose, will likely be made
   by the bargaining team, perhaps with an advisory body of members
   consulting. The bargaining team at Harvard, for example, has consisted
   of about a dozen students representing a unit of some 4,500 students.
   The final tentative agreement that may be reached will likely be voted
   on by the entire union membership, but that means only those
   individuals in the bargaining unit who have decided to actually join
   the union and pay dues. At Harvard, for example, we understand that
   union members currently constitute about 33 percent of the entire
   bargaining unit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   UE CLAIM: The UE will make things better for all MIT graduate students,
   and stipends will never decrease with a union.
   FACT CHECK: The law requires parties to negotiate in good faith on
   mandatory subjects of bargaining, but neither side is required to make
   a particular concession, or agree to a particular proposal. No one can
   guarantee what a final collective bargaining agreement will contain.
   Bargaining does not necessarily begin with the status quo, and MIT,
   like the union, would have the authority to propose changes to the
   status quo. The outcome of such negotiations simply cannot be known in
   advance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   UE CLAIM: A contract will not prevent a student from working more than
   the work-hour limits agreed to by the UE and MIT.
   FACT CHECK: We do not know what a workload article in a future
   collective bargaining agreement will look like, or what restrictions
   may be placed on work hours and assignments.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the

MIT urges every eligible graduate student to cast an informed vote on
unionization

   In the coming weeks, MIT graduate students may be asked to participate
   in a highly consequential election, voting on whether or not to form a
   union represented by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of
   America (UE).
   MIT's leaders respect the right of graduate students to review their
   options and to make their own decisions about whether unionization and
   affiliation with the UE is in their best interest, in pursuit of their
   education.
   We do not believe, however, that unionization is the most constructive
   path forward for our graduate students, as it could replace the
   Institute's current collaborative approach with a more confrontational
   model.
   MIT's leaders are proud of the Institute's recent progress on behalf of
   our graduate students -- achieved through direct and positive
   collaboration with graduate student leaders.
   Moreover, MIT remains committed to preparing its graduate students to
   serve as the next generation of contributors in a range of domains:
   Today's students will lead tomorrow's creation and application of new
   knowledge in the service of a better world.

While voting is not mandatory, it is important that every eligible graduate
student vote, as the decision to elect a graduate student union could impact
the relationship between MIT and its graduate students for decades to come:

     * The outcome of a union election is determined by a simple majority
       of eligible voters who actually vote, not by a majority of those
       who are eligible to vote.
     * If approved, representation by the United Electrical, Radio &
       Machine Workers of America (UE) would be binding on both voting and
       non-voting graduate students in the bargaining unit, with the
       Institute required to recognize the UE as the bargaining
       representative for all graduate students within the certified
       bargaining unit.
     * If a union is elected, that decision could have a [13]lasting
       effect on both current and future MIT graduate students. In most
       cases, this is a decision that is made only once: Unions do not
       stand for re-election, and members do not get to vote regularly on
       whether to keep a union. Rather, once a union is in place, it
       generally stays in place, except in very rare cases. While union
       decertification is possible, it is seldom used in practice, and
       would require a future decertification process initiated by
       bargaining unit members.

Because of the significance of this decision, it is also important that every
graduate student take the time to develop a thorough understanding of what
union representation might and might not accomplish for students at MIT --
and recognize how our graduate students have benefited from MIT's ongoing
collaboration in addressing student needs over the years:

     * Limits of collective bargaining: Employers and unions are required
       by federal law to bargain collectively only over "wages, hours, and
       other terms and conditions of employment." Other issues of
       importance to many students -- such as local housing costs and
       participation in most Institute decision-making -- are outside the
       scope of required collective bargaining negotiations.
     * Unclear union dues structure: It remains unclear how the UE would
       structure its dues for MIT graduate students. But based on the UE's
       charges to employees they represent at other organizations, some
       union members at MIT might expect to pay an estimated $550 in
       annual dues to the UE. Whether or not bargaining unit members would
       be required to join the union as a condition of employment would be
       a matter for negotiations between MIT and the union, but even if it
       is not a requirement, all major decisions on contract ratification,
       strikes, and other matters are likely to be decided upon only by
       paying union members.
     * No guarantee of success: Despite this expense, and the
       [14]possibility of strikes, there is no guarantee that stipends,
       benefits, work hours, or other matters related to employment would
       improve as a result of collective bargaining.
     * Stalled negotiations and strikes elsewhere: In all cases involving
       graduate student unions at private universities, [15]more than a
       year elapsed between a successful unionization vote and arrival at
       a ratified first contract. At Harvard, it took over two years from
       the date of the union certification until a first contract was
       reached. At Columbia University, it took more than four years of
       contentious negotiations and multiple extended strikes for the
       graduate student union to reach its current tentative agreement.
     * MIT's continued collaboration: In contrast to these stalled
       efforts, MIT has continued to work productively and collaboratively
       with graduate students -- even throughout the pandemic -- to
       understand and respond to their needs and priorities.
     * MIT is already a leader on stipends: MIT's minimum graduate student
       stipend, and its 6.25 percent increase to stipends this year,
       already compare favorably to -- and in most cases, are
       substantially more generous than -- the comparable amounts achieved
       by unions at the nine private American universities with unionized
       graduate students.
     * Reduced role of GSC and other existing graduate student groups: If
       the UE wins the election, MIT would no longer be able to work with
       the Graduate Student Council (GSC) or any other graduate student
       group on matters such as compensation and working conditions for
       students in the certified unit. The union would become the
       exclusive bargaining agent on such matters, and it would be illegal
       for MIT to deal with the GSC or another graduate student group on
       any matters affecting wages, hours or working conditions for
       bargaining unit members.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the
   story. MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions,
   discuss issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate
   information.

Student concerns about unionization

   The below FAQs present opinion pieces that students and others have
   written in opposition to forming a union aligned with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE). These FAQs also
   address questions that students have asked about the UE, and about the
   unionization process.

Q: What have students said in opposition to the current unionization effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization
   effort on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The
   Tech:
     * October 6, 2021: [14]"Some concerns about unionization from a
       graduate student"
     * October 21, 2021: [15]"Why we do not need a graduate student union
       at MIT"
     * November 3, 2021: [16]"The UE isn't the union the GSU claims it is"
     __________________________________________________________________

Q: A student-authored website and op-ed in The Tech have raised concerns
about the UE's finances and policy positions. What is the basis for those
concerns?

   A: [17]The student-authored Tech piece highlights concerns about the
   MIT Graduate Student Union's decision to partner with the UE. Students
   have also created an information site ([18]www.uenotformit.org) that
   outlines their reservations about the UE, concluding, "There is no need
   for us to bind ourselves to an organization that we would be
   financially supporting, but which would tie our hands in decisions of
   policy and actively seek to undermine research in various fields."
     __________________________________________________________________

Q: On its website, the UE calls for "a moratorium on the construction of any
additional nuclear fission power plants." What does that mean for MIT
graduate students in nuclear science and engineering?

   A:  We don't yet know how these policy positions might impact potential
   future bargaining between MIT and a graduate student union. Decisions
   about what the union might ask for in bargaining would be up to the
   union and its membership.
     __________________________________________________________________

Q: I've heard that the UE has taken a position of "Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions (BDS)" against Israel in connection with the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. What does this mean, and what can I do if I have concerns about
this?

   A: See the [19]UE's position on "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions
   (BDS)", and other [20]UE policy stances. We have received information
   suggesting that some graduate students and other community members are
   uncomfortable with the UE's BDS position.

   MIT has no role, and will not have any role, in setting union policies.
   We encourage all graduate students to review these policy positions as
   part of making fully informed decisions about whether to support or
   join a union affiliated with the UE.
     __________________________________________________________________

Q: I'm a graduate student who opposes the unionization effort. What am I
allowed to do?

   A: Graduate students who oppose the unionization effort have the same
   rights as those who support the union, and are entitled to take steps
   to organize and make their viewpoints heard. For example, consistent
   with MIT policies, graduate students who oppose the union may set up
   meetings with other students, create and promote websites explaining
   their positions, put up posters, hand out leaflets, talk to the press,
   and generally use all the same communication channels as the students
   who support the union. Students might also consider researching
   graduate student unionization activities at other universities, and the
   steps taken by students at those universities who opposed those
   unionization efforts.
     __________________________________________________________________

Q: Can MIT provide any support to graduate students who oppose the
unionization effort?

   A: MIT is not permitted to provide support to graduate students who
   oppose the unionization effort, or to students who support the union.
   However, consistent with MIT policies, every graduate student has the
   right to express their views on this topic and is permitted to make
   their viewpoints heard.
     __________________________________________________________________

Q: I've heard that MIT filed an anti-union brief in court a few years ago. Is
that true?

   A: In 2016, MIT joined eight other research universities in filing a
   "friend of the court" brief with the National Labor Relations Board
   (NLRB), asking that the NLRB follow its 2004 decision involving Brown
   University. In that decision, the NLRB concluded that graduate
   assistants are primarily students, not employees, and had no rights
   under the National Labor Relations Act.

   MIT joined this brief because the Institute believes that its
   relationship with its graduate teaching and research assistants is
   substantially an educational one, and that unionization of graduate
   students is not the most constructive approach to the multifaceted
   relationship between the student and the Institute.

   In the 2016 case, the NLRB overturned its 2004 position, ruling that
   graduate assistants can be both students and employees. While MIT
   joined this brief with several peer institutions, the Institute accepts
   and respects the NLRB ruling and fully supports the right of graduate
   students to make fully informed decisions on whether to support
   unionization.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the
   story. MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions,
   discuss issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate
   information.

FAQs about Graduate Student Unionization

     * [13]FAQs about Graduate Student Unionization

   In September 2021, a group of MIT graduate students known as the
   [14]MIT Graduate Student Union, affiliated with the [15]United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America, announced a campaign to
   unionize MIT's graduate student population.

   The following frequently asked questions provide answers to questions
   the community may have in light of the students' organizing efforts.
   Students with questions about unions and unionization that are not
   addressed below may contact [16]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.

   Q: What is MIT's position on the formation of a graduate student union?

   A: MIT's leaders do not believe that unionization represents the most
   constructive path forward for our graduate students. They are proud of
   MIT's recent progress on behalf of its graduate students -- achieved
   through working together with graduate student leaders.

   However, MIT's leaders respect the right of graduate students to review
   their options and make their own individual decisions about what's best
   for them in their pursuit of their education. Like the students
   launching this effort, MIT's leadership is committed to advancing a
   learning and work environment of mutual respect and care. In close
   collaboration with the GSC and other student leaders, the Institute and
   its schools have taken steps in recent years to invest in our graduate
   students and to foster positive work, learning, and living experiences
   during their time on campus.
     __________________________________________________________________

BEFORE A UNIONIZATION ELECTION AT MIT

   Q: How is a union selected?

   A: Typically, a group of employees who want a union to represent them
   will affiliate with an established labor union, which will attempt to
   organize a new chapter of that labor union. In this instance, the MIT
   Graduate Student Union (MIT GSU) has chosen to affiliate with the
   United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE). You can
   learn more about the UE on its [17]website.

   The first step in an organizing campaign is for organizers (who could
   be students and/or employees of the union) to ask students in a
   potential bargaining unit to either sign a membership card or an
   "authorization card." Either card serves the same purpose of allowing
   the union to act as their exclusive representative for purposes of
   negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment and to allow
   the union to use the cards to support a showing of interest for
   purposes of filing with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

   Based on their website information, it appears that the MIT GSU has
   chosen to use membership cards rather than authorization cards. The
   card reads as follows:

   Join the Union

   I hereby request and accept membership in the United Electrical, Radio
   and Machine Workers of America (UE), and authorize it to represent me,
   and in my behalf to negotiate and conclude all agreements as to hours
   of labor, wages, and all other conditions of employment.

   Thus, if a student signs such a card, they are actually becoming a
   member of the UE and, presumably, subject to whatever rules the UE may
   have for its members. This does not mean that the Institute must
   automatically recognize the UE as that particular student's
   representative, but it does mean that the student is now a member of
   the UE.

   If the union can collect enough membership cards (or authorization
   cards) to constitute a valid "showing of interest," the union can file
   a "representation petition" with the NLRB requesting a secret-ballot
   election to determine if the union should be the exclusive
   representative of a group of employees which the union considers to be
   an appropriate unit.

   The NLRB considers 30 percent of such a proposed unit to be a valid
   threshold for processing a representation petition. The NLRB will hold
   hearings, if necessary, to determine whether the union's proposed unit
   is appropriate or not.

   However, if the union collects signed membership or authorization cards
   from more than 50 percent of the members in the petitioned-for unit, it
   might request MIT to voluntarily recognize and bargain with the union
   without holding an election. MIT would be under no obligation to agree
   to a voluntary recognition and could insist on an NLRB election.
    1. If there is a union election, would it involve all graduate
       students?
    2. No. It would only involve graduate students in the bargaining unit.
       Graduate students who are outside the bargaining unit (as agreed by
       MIT or deemed appropriate by the National Labor Relations Board)
       would not be eligible to vote in an election.

   Q: What flexibility do student unions have to affiliate with national
   unions, versus forming their own?

   A: Students are free to affiliate with either a national union or to
   form their own independent union. After a union has been certified by
   the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), however, it is difficult to
   change union affiliations. So, in this case, if the UE petitions the
   NLRB for an election and an election is held where the majority of
   voting graduate students in the unit vote in favor of UE
   representation, the NLRB will certify the UE as the sole bargaining
   representative for the certified unit members. Once a union is
   certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), [18]the union
   may not be removed unless decertified by the NLRB.

   Q: What are my rights if a union organizer or a fellow student asks me
   to sign a membership or an authorization card?

   A: It is your decision whether or not you want to sign a membership or
   an authorization card, and all students have the right to sign, or
   refuse to sign, without coercion from anyone and without retaliation.
   The law protects your right not to engage in union activity as well as
   your right to engage in such activity. Because signing the card has
   important implications, you should understand what your signature
   represents before you sign it.

   Q: I signed a membership/authorization card with the United Electrical,
   Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) but have changed my mind. May
   I revoke my card?

   A: While MIT has no role to play on this issue, we note that any
   graduate student who signs a membership/authorization card with the UE
   may request to revoke their card. Normally, they would be able to do so
   by sending a signed letter to the UE requesting that their card be
   revoked.

   Students who have signed a union card are free to vote against the
   union in an election. Cards have no further meaning once an election is
   scheduled.

   Q: Will MIT share graduate students' email addresses or other contact
   information with the union?

   A: Not unless legally required to do so. MIT respects the privacy of
   our graduate students and generally does not disclose personal
   information about them to third parties except with their consent, or
   to MIT-sanctioned organizations and MIT personnel on a need-to-know
   basis. Further, many of our graduate students may also be considered
   employees under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and MIT does
   not provide personal information about employees to organizing unions
   outside the formal National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.

   However, MIT would be required to provide information about graduate
   students to the NLRB in response to any petition for representation
   that may be filed. If this occurs, then the union would have access to
   the same information MIT provides to the NLRB. This information would
   include addresses, job classifications, phone numbers, and personal
   email addresses. MIT would have to disclose such information to the
   NLRB and to the union in the event of a scheduled NLRB election.
     __________________________________________________________________

AFTER A UNIONIZATION ELECTION AT MIT

   Q: If the union should win an election, what would happen next?

   A: MIT would be required to recognize the union as the exclusive
   bargaining representative of all graduate students in the certified
   unit. This would mean, among other things, that the Institute would not
   be able to work with any other body or organization, including the MIT
   Graduate Student Council, on matters affecting wages, hours, and
   working conditions for those in the certified unit, nor could MIT
   negotiate directly with any individual member of the unit on any matter
   affecting wages, hours, and working conditions, unless otherwise
   authorized by the contract.

   It also would mean that both parties -- MIT and the union -- would have
   to meet their obligation to negotiate in good faith for that initial
   collective bargaining agreement. First contracts can take a very long
   time to finalize: [19]A June 2021 Bloomberg Law analysis estimated
   that, on average, it takes 409 days for new unions and their employers
   to sign their first collective bargaining agreement; in all cases
   involving student unions at private universities, more than a year
   elapsed between a successful unionization vote and arrival at a
   ratified initial contract. At Harvard University, this process took
   almost two years, and at Columbia University, there is still no
   contract four years after the union's certification.

   Q: Would all graduate students at MIT be part of a union?

   A: Not necessarily. It depends on whether the graduate student is
   performing work for the Institute (as opposed to solely academic work
   toward their degree) and how the bargaining unit is defined. While all
   graduate students who provide instructional or research work to MIT for
   compensation (e.g., RAs/TAs) are likely to be eligible to unionize
   under current law, the composition of a particular bargaining unit
   depends on who the union seeks to include in the petition; whether MIT
   agrees or not; and, if there is a dispute about the scope of the
   bargaining unit, how the NLRB resolves the dispute.

   While the organizing union first proposes the bargaining unit that it
   wishes to represent, MIT would have the right to challenge the
   appropriateness of that unit. Ultimately, if no agreement on the unit
   can be reached, the NLRB will determine the matter through its
   adjudicatory process.

   Q: If a union won an election at MIT, and I am in the certified
   bargaining unit, would I have to join the union?

   A: Whether you have to actually join the union and pay dues or fees
   depends on subsequent negotiations between the union and MIT.

   It is typical for a union to request a contract provision requiring
   everyone in the unit to join the union or pay an agency fee to the
   union as a condition of employment. A union can negotiate a provision
   in a collective bargaining agreement that requires non-members to pay
   an agency fee to the union in order for the student to be able to
   continue holding an appointment within the bargaining unit. The agency
   fee is usually about the same amount as union dues, but sometimes less.
   If such provisions are negotiated into the contract, then all members
   of the unit would have to abide by them. Otherwise the union could
   lawfully insist that the union member be terminated from their
   bargaining unit position if they do not pay the agency fee. Any of
   these concepts must be negotiated, and MIT may or may not agree to such
   proposals.

   Regardless of whether you formally join the union, or whether an agency
   fee is required for non-members, the union would become your exclusive
   bargaining representative in the event the union were to win an
   election. Therefore, it is also important to understand that, even if
   you don't join the union, the terms of the contract with the union are
   binding on all employees in the bargaining unit.

   Q: Could MIT make exceptions to provisions in a collective bargaining
   agreement to accommodate the needs of individual graduate students?

   A: As a general rule, no. MIT would be bound by the provisions of the
   collective bargaining agreement. Unless such exceptions are provided
   for in the contract or otherwise agreed to by the union, they are not
   permitted.

   For example, if a contract set parameters on the work hours for a
   research assistant, an individual graduate student would not be able to
   make personal arrangements with their advisor or PI to work outside
   those parameters, unless the contract provided for exceptions or unless
   the union agreed to such arrangements.
     __________________________________________________________________

UNION DUES, NEGOTIATIONS, AND BEYOND

   Q: What would the union dues be at MIT if students voted for a union?

   A: Every union sets its own dues structure. Some do it by setting dues
   based on fixed amounts per month; others use a percentage of
   compensation.

   At New York University, for example, graduate students who are members
   of the United Auto Workers of America (UAW) pay 2 percent of their
   hourly wages during the semesters in which they are employed, and the
   dues are automatically deducted from every paycheck. In addition to
   dues, the UAW charges each member an initiation fee of approximately
   $50. Union dues at Harvard University, where the UAW is also the
   representative of student workers, are 1.44 percent of all compensation
   that the graduate student union member receives.

   It remains unclear how the UE would structure its dues for MIT graduate
   students, although it seems that they, too, would charge 1.44 percent
   of compensation. Thus, some MIT graduate student union members might
   expect to pay the union about $550 annually. If there is a "union shop"
   or union security clause in any collective bargaining agreement,
   non-members in the bargaining unit may also be required to pay an
   agency fee. Agency fees are often the same amount as union dues;
   sometimes less.

   Q: In collective bargaining negotiations, can MIT propose its own
   provisions or changes from the status quo?

   A: Yes. Both MIT and the union representatives are free to propose any
   items or provisions for the contract, including changes from the status
   quo involving wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of
   employment.

   Employers and unions are required by federal law to bargain
   collectively over "wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of
   employment." Other issues of importance to many students -- such as
   local housing costs and participation in Institute decision-making --
   are outside the scope of what is required to be negotiated.

   Q: How are student interests represented in these negotiations? Will I
   get input into what should be negotiated into the contract? Who will
   the leadership of the union be?

   A: It is up to the union to determine who serves in the leadership, who
   serves on the negotiating team, and how it solicits and/or considers
   input from its members.

   Q: If a union wins an election, will my stipend increase? What about
   benefits?

   A: The law requires negotiations over compensation (i.e., payment for
   work provided by the union members to MIT). Stipends that are strictly
   financial aid support, and not linked to work provided by graduate
   students in the bargaining unit, would not be subject to collective
   bargaining.

   For stipends that are linked to, for example, TA or RA appointments,
   and therefore subject to bargaining, there is no guarantee that any
   union can obtain improvements -- or if so, how much -- as all such
   matters are subject to negotiations. It is fair to say that usually
   some increases in compensation can be found in most contracts. However,
   the amount is subject to negotiations and is not necessarily greater
   than what could have been achieved without a union. For example, MIT
   has raised stipends every year in recent memory without a union.
   Benefits are also mandatory subjects of bargaining, but may or may not
   change as a result of collective bargaining.

   Q: Would a graduate student union at MIT dictate the number of hours I
   can work as a graduate research assistant for positions included in the
   bargaining unit?

   A: We don't know. This would first depend on the type of unit that is
   certified and whether research assistants are included in the unit. For
   example, research assistants are not included in the bargaining units
   at Brandeis University or at New York University. On the other hand,
   they are included in the Harvard University bargaining unit.

   If they are included in the unit, then the number of hours of work is
   subject to bargaining if the graduate student is receiving compensation
   for such research. Many graduate assistant contracts have detailed
   workload provisions that include expectations, as well as limitations,
   on hours of work.

   Q: What impact could a union have on research activities, such as
   attendance at conferences, engaging in fieldwork, or research conducted
   at other activities?

   A: We don't know. To the extent that such activities are part of a
   research assistantship, funding for attendance at conferences, travel,
   and other activities could be subject to negotiation with the union.

   Q: What would happen to the MIT Graduate Student Council if a union was
   created?

   A: With a union created, the Graduate Student Council would no longer
   be permitted to discuss or negotiate with the MIT administration any
   issues concerning wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of
   employment for members of the bargaining unit. Under federal labor law,
   once a union wins an election, it becomes the exclusive bargaining
   representative over all terms and conditions of employment. It would be
   illegal for the Institute to continue to deal with the GSC on such
   matters.

   Q: What is the process for changing affiliations after a union has been
   established?

   A: Once a union is certified by the National Labor Relations Board
   (NLRB), [20]the union may not be removed unless decertified by the
   NLRB. Similar to the certification process, employees seeking to remove
   or replace the existing union with a different union must get at least
   30 percent of their coworkers to sign cards in order to file a petition
   asking the NLRB to conduct an election.

STUDENT OPINIONS FOR AND AGAINST UNIONIZATION

   Q: What have students said in support of the current unionization
   effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization
   effort on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The
   Tech:
     * October 21, 2021: [21]"With a union, graduate working conditions
       become an institutional priority"
     * November 15, 2021: [22]"Graduate student-leaders: only a union can
       secure real change at MIT"
     * November 15, 2021: [23]"The MIT GSU and UE will bring a history of
       social justice to the future of MIT"
     * November 15, 2021: [24]"International student workers deserve fair
       treatment"

   Q: What have students said in opposition to the current unionization
   effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization
   effort on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The
   Tech:
     * October 6, 2021: [25]"Some concerns about unionization from a
       graduate student"
     * October 21, 2021: [26]"Why we do not need a graduate student union
       at MIT"
     * November 3, 2021: [27]"The UE isn't the union the GSU claims it is"

   Q: A student-authored website and op-ed in The Tech have raised
   concerns about the UE's finances and policy positions. What is the
   basis for those concerns?

   A: [28]The student-authored [29]Tech[30] piece highlights concerns
   about the MIT Graduate Student Union's decision to partner with the UE.
   Students have also created an information site
   ([31]www.uenotformit.org) that outlines their reservations about the
   UE, concluding, "There is no need for us to bind ourselves to an
   organization that we would be financially supporting, but which would
   tie our hands in decisions of policy and actively seek to undermine
   research in various fields."

   Q: On its website, the UE calls for "a moratorium on the construction
   of any additional nuclear fission power plants." What does that mean
   for MIT graduate students in nuclear science and engineering?

   A:  We don't yet know how these policy positions might impact potential
   future bargaining between MIT and a graduate student union. The initial
   decisions about what the union might ask for in bargaining would be up
   to the union and its membership.

   Q: I've heard that the UE has taken a position of "Boycott, Divestment
   and Sanctions (BDS)" against Israel in connection with the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What does this mean, and what can I do if
   I have concerns about this?

   A: The UE's position on "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)" is
   referenced [32]here, and other UE policy stances are available
   [33]here. We have received information suggesting that some graduate
   students are uncomfortable with the UE's BDS position.

   MIT has no role, and will not have any role, in setting union policies.
   We encourage all graduate students to review these policy positions as
   part of making fully informed decisions about whether to support or
   join a union aligned with the UE.

   Q: I'm a graduate student who opposes the unionization effort. What am
   I allowed to do?

   A: Graduate students who oppose the unionization effort have the same
   rights as those who support the union, and are entitled to take steps
   to organize and make their viewpoints heard. For example, consistent
   with MIT policies, graduate students who oppose the union may set up
   meetings with other students, create and promote websites explaining
   their positions, put up posters, hand out leaflets, talk to the press,
   and generally use all the same communication channels as the student
   organizers who support the union. Students might also consider
   researching graduate student unionization activities at other
   universities, and the steps taken by students who supported or opposed
   those unionization efforts.

   Q: Can MIT provide any support to graduate students who oppose the
   unionization effort?

   A: MIT is not permitted to provide support to graduate students who
   oppose the unionization effort, or to those who support it. However,
   consistent with MIT's policies, every graduate student has the right to
   express their views on this topic and is permitted to make their
   viewpoints heard.

   Q: I've heard that MIT filed an anti-union brief in court a few years
   ago. What's the background on that?

   A: In 2016, MIT joined eight other research universities in filing a
   "friend of the court" brief with the National Labor Relations Board
   (NLRB), asking that the NLRB follow its 2004 decision involving Brown
   University. In that decision, the NLRB concluded that graduate
   assistants are students, not employees.

   MIT joined this brief because the Institute believes that its
   relationship with its graduate teaching and research assistants is
   substantially an educational one, and that unionization of graduate
   students may not be the most constructive approach to the multifaceted
   relationship between the student and the Institute.

   In the 2016 case, the NLRB overturned its 2004 position, ruling that
   graduate assistants can be both students and employees. While MIT
   joined this brief with several peer institutions, the Institute accepts
   and respects the NLRB ruling and fully supports the right of students
   to make independent decisions on whether to support unionization.

   Q: What other opinions have been shared regarding the current
   unionization effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization
   effort on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The
   Tech:
     * October 28, 2021: [34]"A $6,000 bill and inadequate coverage: How
       MIT health insurance fails graduate workers"
     * November 3, 2021: [35]"Director of MIT Medical responds to `How MIT
       health insurance fails graduate workers'"
     * November 9, 2021: [36]"Institute for Work and Employment Research
       faculty comment on potential graduate student unionization"

GENERAL INFORMATION ON UNIONS AND THE UNIONIZATION PROCESS

   Q: What is the NLRB?

   A: The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is a federal agency
   created to enforce the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), a federal
   law to protect the rights of employees and employers. The law protects
   the rights of employees to choose or reject union representation.

   Q: What is a union?

   A: A union, or labor organization, is any organization or association
   of any kind in which employees participate and which exists for the
   purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers on wages,
   benefits, hours, grievances or other terms or conditions of employment.
   A union that represents a majority of employees in an "appropriate
   bargaining unit," and that has been certified by the NLRB following an
   election or voluntarily recognized by an employer, serves as the
   representative of that bargaining unit on all such matters involving
   wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. An
   appropriate bargaining unit is a group of employees who share a clear
   and identifiable community of interest sufficient to be represented by
   a union.

   A union that has been certified by the NLRB, or that has been
   voluntarily recognized by an employer, negotiates a contract (also
   known as a collective bargaining agreement) on behalf of the bargaining
   unit to establish the terms and conditions of employment, including
   such things as wages, hours of work, benefits, and other working
   conditions. A union also represents its members when disputes arise
   over the terms of the contract.

   Q: What are union dues?

   A: Dues are the cost of membership in a union. They are used to cover
   the costs of negotiating a contract, contract administration and
   resolutions of grievances (claims of breach of contract). In addition,
   unions also use dues for the purpose of organizing employees at other
   employers, and to make political contributions.

   Q: What is the election process to form a union?

   A: The election process is conducted and supervised by representatives
   of the NLRB. An election is typically held within approximately three
   or four weeks after the filing of a representation petition by the
   union, but the timing may differ depending upon how the NLRB treats
   outstanding bargaining unit issues, and how long it takes to resolve
   those issues. Once an election date is set, secret ballot voting would
   likely take place in a central location at a designated date and time,
   or by a mail-in process, as determined by the NLRB.

   The election outcome is determined by a simple majority of those who
   actually vote, not by a majority of all eligible voters. Union
   representation will be determined by voters, and will be binding on
   both voters and non-voters in the proposed bargaining unit. Therefore,
   it is important that all members of a proposed bargaining unit vote,
   even if they are not interested in unionization.

   Those who have already signed membership or authorization cards are not
   obligated to vote in favor of the union during the secret ballot
   election: They are free to change their mind. Once a petition is filed
   with the NLRB, and the showing of interest is confirmed, membership or
   authorization cards usually serve no further purpose.

   Q: What does the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) say regarding
   negotiations?

   A: Section 8(d) of the NLRA states:

   For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the
   performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the
   representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer
   in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and
   conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any
   question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written contract
   incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but
   such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or
   require the making of a concession.

   Q: Is anything required to be in a collective bargaining agreement?

   A: No, the NLRA does not require that any particular right or provision
   be part of a contract. Collective bargaining agreements normally have
   provisions on compensation and benefits, workload and assignments,
   hours of work, grievance procedures and a variety of other provisions,
   but no particular provisions are mandated by law. You may find some
   contracts have a particular provision but another contract might not --
   it all depends on what those parties have chosen to include in their
   agreements. The law requires good-faith negotiations over mandatory
   subjects of bargaining. However, the law specifically does not require
   either party to make a particular concession or to agree to a
   particular proposal during negotiations.

   Q: What might be covered in a union contract?

   A: The NLRA requires employers and unions to bargain collectively over
   "wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment." These are
   called mandatory subjects of bargaining, over which the parties
   mustnegotiate.

   Other topics of interest that do not fall under the umbrella of
   mandatory negotiations might be addressed by the parties as
   "permissive" subjects -- topics over which neither side is required to
   negotiate. Items such as the hiring process and housing costs would
   fall into that category. The NLRB has not yet addressed with any
   specificity what "terms and conditions of employment" are in the
   graduate student context. In a case involving Columbia University
   graduate students, the NLRB stated that academic decisions remain the
   prerogative of the university, but what constitutes an academic versus
   a non-academic decision is not yet clear.

   There may be many issues of importance to our students that would not
   be considered mandatory subjects of bargaining under the law, such as
   concerns about student housing.

   Some guidance about the terms and conditions that may be addressed in a
   contract can be gleaned from examining other graduate student
   contracts. For example, the contract between Harvard University and its
   graduate student teaching and research assistants represented by the
   United Auto Workers (UAW) covers numerous terms and conditions of
   employment such as salaries, benefits, working hours, and grievance
   procedures; nondiscrimination provisions; leaves of absence; job
   postings; and access to offices.

   However, many rights are retained by Harvard. In the Harvard contract
   with the UAW, the university retains the exclusive right to determine
   and control the university's mission, objectives, priorities,
   operations, and resources, among many other rights. Harvard also
   retains the right to control "all matters of academic judgment and
   decision-making, including `who is taught, what is taught, how it is
   taught and who does the teaching.'" All matters affecting research
   methodology and materials, and external grants including application,
   selection, funding, administration, usage, accountability, and
   termination are also retained by Harvard.

   Also, there are great variations in union contracts because it is up to
   the parties to those contracts to decide what they will agree to and
   what they will not. The appearance of a clause in one contract -- no
   matter what it is -- does not guarantee that it will appear in an MIT
   contract if the union were to be elected.

   Q: How many graduate student union contracts are there around the
   country?

   A: There are about 42 graduate student contracts, according to the
   National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher
   Education and the Professions. The majority are at public universities;
   there are only nine graduate student union contracts in the private
   sector, at American University, Brandeis University, Brown University,
   Columbia University, Georgetown University, Harvard University, The New
   School, New York University, and Tufts University.

   Q: Does the UE represent graduate students anywhere else?

   A: To the best of our knowledge, the only contract they currently have
   in place is at the University of Iowa.

   Q: Are state labor laws different from the NLRA?

   A: Yes. In many cases, state and federal laws differ significantly when
   it comes to issues such as bargaining topics, negotiation impasse
   procedures, the right to strike, and required union membership. For
   example, strikes are prohibited under most state laws, making strikes
   rare at public universities, but strikes are legal in the private
   sector.

   Many state laws also, for example, specify what issues are considered
   "terms and conditions of employment," and therefore subject to
   collective bargaining, and what issues are "academic," and therefore
   not subject to collective bargaining. Federal law is not tailored to
   address the issues of academic and educational matters related to
   graduate student activities.

   Q: How long do student union contract negotiations typically take? Have
   students represented by unions at other universities gone on strike?

   A: [37]A June 2021 Bloomberg Law analysis estimated that, on average,
   it takes 409 days for new unions and their employers to sign their
   first collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The analysis is depicted
   in the following chart:

   The table below provides examples of the length of student union
   contract negotiations at other institutions of higher education based
   on available information, and also notes when student-authorized
   strikes have taken place:

   * Negotiations began in October 2018 and ended in June 2020, and
   included a 29-day strike in December 2019. The parties initially agreed
   only to a one-year contract, which expired on June 30, 2021. The
   parties agreed to a second contract, which was ratified in November
   2021, with 70.6 percent of voters in support of the new deal, and after
   a three-day strike and the threat of a second strike.

   ** Columbia University has not yet reached an initial agreement with
   its union. The NLRB election was held in December 2016; the NLRB issued
   its decision certifying the union on December 16, 2017. Negotiations
   for a first contract started in February 2019 and a tentative agreement
   was reached in April 2021 but was voted down by union members. In July
   2021, union members elected a new union bargaining committee after all
   10 members of the union's bargaining committee stepped down. In
   September 2021, union members authorized a strike and on November 3,
   2021, the strike commenced.

Office of the Vice Chancellor Diversity Statement

   The offices that comprise OVC enable and enhance MIT academics while
   supporting the intellectual, personal, and professional growth of all
   MIT students. We believe we can only empower students once we respect
   who they are and where they come from; empowering students requires a
   holistic perspective that celebrates the diversity of our community and
   champions the value of that diversity. We believe that a diverse
   student body is foundational to the innovative and creative work of the
   Institute because when [17]students from different backgrounds and
   interests come together, they make each other better, learn from one
   another, surprise, and inspire us all.

   Just as diversity is a strength of the student body, the many different
   backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences of our staff enrich the work
   we do to help students reach their goals. Our aim is not only to uphold
   MIT's non-discrimination policies, but to create a genuinely inclusive
   environment for OVC staff and the students we serve.

   In our work, the OVC does not discriminate against individuals on the
   basis of any aspect of identity or difference, including but not
   limited to race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation,
   religion, national origin, disability, citizenship, age, political
   views, socioeconomic status, veteran status, immigration status or
   physical appearance. This approach affects all aspects of OVC work
   including services for students, administration of policies and
   procedures, hiring practices, and administration of programs,
   initiatives and activities.

   We believe that the mental and physical well-being of our students is
   foundational to learning. We are committed to fostering an emotionally
   supportive environment where students can be their authentic selves,
   flourish as community members, and do their best work. We build this
   environment by supporting each other, promoting our own self-care as
   staff members, and engaging in and encouraging respectful discourse
   among students, staff, and faculty. OVC is committed to the meaningful
   inclusion of all community members and actively advances
   underrepresented voices.

   We do not assume that our organization is immune to biases or power
   imbalances. The many aspects of our identities confer various mindsets,
   expectations, and levels of privilege. We are committed to
   understanding and overcoming the many dimensions of exclusion that we
   are all exposed to through socialization. We are committed to educating
   and training students, staff, and faculty to recognize our inherent
   biases and correct injustices in our realms of influence.  Each
   person's perspective is unique, and when all of us come together in the
   genuine spirit of learning, our distinct views can combine to produce a
   stronger and more equitable MIT.

   "We want to give our students the best educational experience on the
   planet." --Ian A. Waitz

Our Charge

   The charge given to the Office of the Vice Chancellor (OVC) by the
   Office of the Chancellor is:
     * Engaging with students and departments to develop and pursue a
       roadmap for enhancing the first year student academic experience;
     * Partnering with community members to make improvements for our
       students in areas such as advising, professional development,
       diversity and inclusion, and well-being;
     * Implementing the residential education innovations called for in
       the [23]Institute-wide Task Force on the Future of MIT Education;
       and
     * Working with the staff from undergraduate and graduate education to
       conduct an organizational review that positions the two offices to
       support the above efforts, as well as optimize services for our
       students and faculty.

Strategic Priorities

     * Enhance the undergraduate experience
     * Serve our graduate students
     * Promote diversity, inclusion & well-being
     * Broaden advising, career services & prof development
     * Strengthen academic infrastructure
     * Live our mission and values

Key Elements

     * Learning is central: The Teaching and Learning Lab plays a central
       role in OVC. Their evidence-based approach, in terms of using the
       latest literature in the field on teaching and student learning and
       tying that to assessing and evaluating outcomes, is the way we
       pursue our priorities.
     * Cross-functional teams are core: Dashed lines can more effective,
       flexible, and empowering than reorganizing boxes. We also strive to
       provide a diversity of perspectives wherever possible from staff as
       part of these teams. In addition, creating more cross-functional
       teams enhances professional development for our staff. These
       cross-functional teams include participants from not only the OVC,
       but from across MIT, as well.
     * Building on our strengths is critical: During the reorganiztion,
       the vice chancellor observed that the OVC staff is executing many
       core programs and services with excellence. We don't want to
       disrupt what is going well in terms of delivering important
       services to our students. We do expect that some people's roles may
       change over time--in most instances, we hope, in ways that are
       energizing. There will be opportunities for staff to work together
       in different ways, which we hope they'll find engaging.
     * Balancing priorities, remaining focused is crucial: Given the
       ambitious charge, set of priorities, and the reality that OVC will
       remain relatively the same size in terms of resources, success will
       rely upon finding the right balance and leveraging what we already
       do well. Practically, this means focusing on crucial day-to-day
       activities (and optimizing where possible); combining / working
       together where we can; and in some cases, spinning non-core, less
       impactful elements down (and by that we mean, not people, but
       activities).
