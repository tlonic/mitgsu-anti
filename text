                    FAQs about Graduate Student Unionization

     o [21]FAQs about Graduate Student Unionization

   Updated March 15, 2022

   In September 2021, a group of MIT graduate students known as the [22]MIT
   Graduate Student Union, affiliated with the [23]United Electrical, Radio &
   Machine Workers of America, announced a campaign to unionize MIT***s
   graduate student population.

   The following frequently asked questions provide answers to questions the
   community may have in light of the students*** organizing efforts.
   Students with questions about unions and unionization that are not
   addressed below may contact [24]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.

   Q: What is MIT's position on the formation of a graduate student union?

   A: MIT***s leaders do not believe that unionization represents the most
   constructive path forward for our graduate students. They are proud of
   MIT***s recent progress on behalf of its graduate students *** achieved
   through working together with graduate student leaders.

   However, MIT***s leaders respect the right of graduate students to review
   their options and make their own individual decisions about what***s best
   for them in their pursuit of their education. Like the students launching
   this effort, MIT***s leadership is committed to advancing a learning and
   work environment of mutual respect and care. In close collaboration with
   the GSC and other student leaders, the Institute and its schools have
   taken steps in recent years to invest in our graduate students and to
   foster positive work, learning, and living experiences during their time
   on campus.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  BEFORE A UNIONIZATION ELECTION AT MIT

   Q: How is a union selected?

   A: Typically, a group of employees who want a union to represent them will
   affiliate with an established labor union, which will attempt to organize
   a new chapter of that labor union. In this instance, the MIT Graduate
   Student Union (MIT GSU) has chosen to affiliate with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE). You can learn more
   about the UE on its [25]website.

   The first step in an organizing campaign is for organizers (who could be
   students and/or employees of the union) to ask students in a potential
   bargaining unit to either sign a membership card or an ***authorization
   card.*** Either card serves the same purpose of allowing the union to act
   as their exclusive representative for purposes of negotiating the terms
   and conditions of their employment and to allow the union to use the cards
   to support a showing of interest for purposes of filing with the National
   Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

   Based on their website information, it appears that the MIT GSU has chosen
   to use membership cards rather than authorization cards. The card reads as
   follows:

   Join the Union

   I hereby request and accept membership in the United Electrical, Radio and
   Machine Workers of America (UE), and authorize it to represent me, and in
   my behalf to negotiate and conclude all agreements as to hours of labor,
   wages, and all other conditions of employment.

   Thus, if a student signs such a card, they are actually becoming a member
   of the UE and, presumably, subject to whatever rules the UE may have for
   its members. This does not mean that the Institute must automatically
   recognize the UE as that particular student***s representative, but it
   does mean that the student is now a member of the UE.

   If the union can collect enough membership cards (or authorization cards)
   to constitute a valid ***showing of interest,*** the union can file a
   ***representation petition*** with the NLRB requesting a secret-ballot
   election to determine if the union should be the exclusive representative
   of a group of employees which the union considers to be an appropriate
   unit.

   The NLRB considers 30 percent of such a proposed unit to be a valid
   threshold for processing a representation petition. The NLRB will hold
   hearings, if necessary, to determine whether the union***s proposed unit
   is appropriate or not.

   However, if the union collects signed membership or authorization cards
   from more than 50 percent of the members in the petitioned-for unit, it
   might request MIT to voluntarily recognize and bargain with the union
   without holding an election. MIT would be under no obligation to agree to
   a voluntary recognition and could insist on an NLRB election.

    1. If there is a union election, would it involve all graduate students?
    2. No. It would only involve graduate students in the bargaining unit.
       Graduate students who are outside the bargaining unit (as agreed by
       MIT or deemed appropriate by the National Labor Relations Board) would
       not be eligible to vote in an election.

   Q: What flexibility do student unions have to affiliate with national
   unions, versus forming their own?

   A: Students are free to affiliate with either a national union or to form
   their own independent union. After a union has been certified by the
   National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), however, it is difficult to change
   union affiliations. So, in this case, if the UE petitions the NLRB for an
   election and an election is held where the majority of voting graduate
   students in the unit vote in favor of UE representation, the NLRB will
   certify the UE as the sole bargaining representative for the certified
   unit members. Once a union is certified by the National Labor Relations
   Board (NLRB), [26]the union may not be removed unless decertified by the
   NLRB.

   Q: What are my rights if a union organizer or a fellow student asks me to
   sign a membership or an authorization card?

   A: It is your decision whether or not you want to sign a membership or an
   authorization card, and all students have the right to sign, or refuse to
   sign, without coercion from anyone and without retaliation. The law
   protects your right not to engage in union activity as well as your right
   to engage in such activity. Because signing the card has important
   implications, you should understand what your signature represents before
   you sign it.

   Q: I signed a membership/authorization card with the United Electrical,
   Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) but have changed my mind. May I
   revoke my card?

   A: While MIT has no role to play on this issue, we note that any graduate
   student who signs a membership/authorization card with the UE may request
   to revoke their card. Normally, they would be able to do so by sending a
   signed letter to the UE requesting that their card be revoked.

   Students who have signed a union card are free to vote against the union
   in an election. Cards have no further meaning once an election is
   scheduled.

   Q: Will MIT share graduate students*** email addresses or other contact
   information with the union?

   A: Not unless legally required to do so. MIT respects the privacy of our
   graduate students and generally does not disclose personal information
   about them to third parties except with their consent, or to
   MIT-sanctioned organizations and MIT personnel on a need-to-know basis.
   Further, many of our graduate students may also be considered employees
   under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and MIT does not provide
   personal information about employees to organizing unions outside the
   formal National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.

   However, MIT would be required to provide information about graduate
   students to the NLRB in response to any petition for representation that
   may be filed. If this occurs, then the union would have access to the same
   information MIT provides to the NLRB. This information would include
   addresses, job classifications, phone numbers, and personal email
   addresses. MIT would have to disclose such information to the NLRB and to
   the union in the event of a scheduled NLRB election.

   Q.**Are graduate students who are active duty military and/or funded by
   the military eligible to vote in the union election? If they would be in
   the bargaining unit, must they actually join the union if one is elected?
   All active-duty military and/or military-funded students with partial or
   full RA, TA, and Instructor G appointments are eligible to vote. For more
   information about voting eligibility, [27]please see here.

   If the UE wins the election at MIT, the Institute will be required to
   recognize the UE as the exclusive bargaining representative of all
   graduate students in the proposed bargaining unit (including all RAs and
   TAs), including any students in the unit who are active duty military or
   funded by the military. **All students in the bargaining unit would be
   bound by the terms of any collective bargaining agreement reached between
   MIT and the UE.

   Whether a student has to actually join the union (i.e. become a union
   member and pay membership dues), or pay agency fees to the union, would be
   the subject of negotiations between MIT and the UE.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  AFTER A UNIONIZATION ELECTION AT MIT

   Q: If the union should win an election, what would happen next?

   A: MIT would be required to recognize the union as the exclusive
   bargaining representative of all graduate students in the certified unit.
   This would mean, among other things, that the Institute would not be able
   to work with any other body or organization, including the MIT Graduate
   Student Council, on matters affecting wages, hours, and working conditions
   for those in the certified unit, nor could MIT negotiate directly with any
   individual member of the unit on any matter affecting wages, hours, and
   working conditions, unless otherwise authorized by the contract.

   It also would mean that both parties *** MIT and the union *** would have
   to meet their obligation to negotiate in good faith for that initial
   collective bargaining agreement. First contracts can take a very long time
   to finalize: [28]A June 2021 Bloomberg Law analysis estimated that, on
   average, it takes 409 days for new unions and their employers to sign
   their first collective bargaining agreement; in all cases involving
   student unions at private universities, more than a year elapsed between a
   successful unionization vote and arrival at a ratified initial contract.
   At Harvard University, this process took almost two years, and at Columbia
   University, there is still no contract four years after the union***s
   certification.

   Q: Would all graduate students at MIT be part of a union?

   A: Not necessarily. It depends on whether the graduate student is
   performing work for the Institute (as opposed to solely academic work
   toward their degree) and how the bargaining unit is defined. While all
   graduate students who provide instructional or research work to MIT for
   compensation (e.g., RAs/TAs) are likely to be eligible to unionize under
   current law, the composition of a particular bargaining unit depends on
   who the union seeks to include in the petition; whether MIT agrees or not;
   and, if there is a dispute about the scope of the bargaining unit, how the
   NLRB resolves the dispute.

   While the organizing union first proposes the bargaining unit that it
   wishes to represent, MIT would have the right to challenge the
   appropriateness of that unit. Ultimately, if no agreement on the unit can
   be reached, the NLRB will determine the matter through its adjudicatory
   process.

   Q: If a union won an election at MIT, and I am in the certified bargaining
   unit, would I have to join the union?

   A: Whether you have to actually join the union and pay dues or fees
   depends on subsequent negotiations between the union and MIT.

   It is typical for a union to request a contract provision requiring
   everyone in the unit to join the union or pay an agency fee to the union
   as a condition of employment. A union can negotiate a provision in a
   collective bargaining agreement that requires non-members to pay an agency
   fee to the union in order for the student to be able to continue holding
   an appointment within the bargaining unit. The agency fee is usually about
   the same amount as union dues, but sometimes less. If such provisions are
   negotiated into the contract, then all members of the unit would have to
   abide by them. Otherwise the union could lawfully insist that the union
   member be terminated from their bargaining unit position if they do not
   pay the agency fee. Any of these concepts must be negotiated, and MIT may
   or may not agree to such proposals.

   Regardless of whether you formally join the union, or whether an agency
   fee is required for non-members, the union would become your exclusive
   bargaining representative in the event the union were to win an election.
   Therefore, it is also important to understand that, even if you don***t
   join the union, the terms of the contract with the union are binding on
   all employees in the bargaining unit.

   Q: Could MIT make exceptions to provisions in a collective bargaining
   agreement to accommodate the needs of individual graduate students?

   A: As a general rule, no. MIT would be bound by the provisions of the
   collective bargaining agreement. Unless such exceptions are provided for
   in the contract or otherwise agreed to by the union, they are not
   permitted.

   For example, if a contract set parameters on the work hours for a research
   assistant, an individual graduate student would not be able to make
   personal arrangements with their advisor or PI to work outside those
   parameters, unless the contract provided for exceptions or unless the
   union agreed to such arrangements.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  UNION DUES, NEGOTIATIONS, AND BEYOND

   Q: What would the union dues be at MIT if students voted for a union?

   A: Every union sets its own dues structure. Some do it by setting dues
   based on fixed amounts per month; others use a percentage of compensation.

   At New York University, for example, graduate students who are members of
   the United Auto Workers of America (UAW) pay 2 percent of their hourly
   wages during the semesters in which they are employed, and the dues are
   automatically deducted from every paycheck. In addition to dues, the UAW
   charges each member an initiation fee of approximately $50. Union dues at
   Harvard University, where the UAW is also the representative of student
   workers, are 1.44 percent of all compensation that the graduate student
   union member receives.

   It remains unclear how the UE would structure its dues for MIT graduate
   students, although it seems that they, too, would charge 1.44 percent of
   compensation. Thus, some MIT graduate student union members might expect
   to pay the union about $550 annually. If there is a ***union shop*** or
   union security clause in any collective bargaining agreement, non-members
   in the bargaining unit may also be required to pay an agency fee. Agency
   fees are often the same amount as union dues; sometimes less.

   Q: In collective bargaining negotiations, can MIT propose its own
   provisions or changes from the status quo?

   A: Yes. Both MIT and the union representatives are free to propose any
   items or provisions for the contract, including changes from the status
   quo involving wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.

   Employers and unions are required by federal law to bargain collectively
   over ***wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.***
   Other issues of importance to many students *** such as local housing
   costs and participation in Institute decision-making *** are outside the
   scope of what is required to be negotiated.

   Q: How are student interests represented in these negotiations? Will I get
   input into what should be negotiated into the contract? Who will the
   leadership of the union be?

   A: It is up to the union to determine who serves in the leadership, who
   serves on the negotiating team, and how it solicits and/or considers input
   from its members.

   Q: If a union wins an election, will my stipend increase? What about
   benefits?

   A: The law requires negotiations over compensation (i.e., payment for work
   provided by the union members to MIT). Stipends that are strictly
   financial aid support, and not linked to work provided by graduate
   students in the bargaining unit, would not be subject to collective
   bargaining.

   For stipends that are linked to, for example, TA or RA appointments, and
   therefore subject to bargaining, there is no guarantee that any union can
   obtain improvements *** or if so, how much *** as all such matters are
   subject to negotiations. It is fair to say that usually some increases in
   compensation can be found in most contracts. However, the amount is
   subject to negotiations and is not necessarily greater than what could
   have been achieved without a union. For example, MIT has raised stipends
   every year in recent memory without a union. Benefits are also mandatory
   subjects of bargaining, but may or may not change as a result of
   collective bargaining.

   Q: Would a graduate student union at MIT dictate the number of hours I can
   work as a graduate research assistant for positions included in the
   bargaining unit?

   A: We don***t know. This would first depend on the type of unit that is
   certified and whether research assistants are included in the unit. For
   example, research assistants are not included in the bargaining units at
   Brandeis University or at New York University. On the other hand, they are
   included in the Harvard University bargaining unit.

   If they are included in the unit, then the number of hours of work is
   subject to bargaining if the graduate student is receiving compensation
   for such research. Many graduate assistant contracts have detailed
   workload provisions that include expectations, as well as limitations, on
   hours of work.

   Q: What impact could a union have on research activities, such as
   attendance at conferences, engaging in fieldwork, or research conducted at
   other activities?

   A: We don***t know. To the extent that such activities are part of a
   research assistantship, funding for attendance at conferences, travel, and
   other activities could be subject to negotiation with the union.

   Q: What would happen to the MIT Graduate Student Council if a union was
   created?

   A: With a union created, the Graduate Student Council would no longer be
   permitted to discuss or negotiate with the MIT administration any issues
   concerning wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment for
   members of the bargaining unit. Under federal labor law, once a union wins
   an election, it becomes the exclusive bargaining representative over all
   terms and conditions of employment. It would be illegal for the Institute
   to continue to deal with the GSC on such matters.

   Q: What is the process for changing affiliations after a union has been
   established?

   A: Once a union is certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB),
   [29]the union may not be removed unless decertified by the NLRB. Similar
   to the certification process, employees seeking to remove or replace the
   existing union with a different union must get at least 30 percent of
   their coworkers to sign cards in order to file a petition asking the NLRB
   to conduct an election.

  STUDENT OPINIONS FOR AND AGAINST UNIONIZATION

   Q: What have students said in support of the current unionization effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization effort
   on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The Tech:

     o October 21, 2021: [30]***With a union, graduate working conditions
       become an institutional priority***
     o November 15, 2021: [31]***Graduate student-leaders: only a union can
       secure real change at MIT***
     o November 15, 2021: [32]***The MIT GSU and UE will bring a history of
       social justice to the future of MIT***
     o November 15, 2021: [33]***International student workers deserve fair
       treatment***

   Q: What have students said in opposition to the current unionization
   effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization effort
   on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The Tech:

     o October 6, 2021: [34]***Some concerns about unionization from a
       graduate student***
     o October 21, 2021: [35]***Why we do not need a graduate student union
       at MIT***
     o November 3, 2021: [36]***The UE isn***t the union the GSU claims it
       is***

   Q: A student-authored website and op-ed in The Tech have raised concerns
   about the UE***s finances and policy positions. What is the basis for
   those concerns?

   A: [37]The student-authored [38]Tech [39]piece highlights concerns about
   the MIT Graduate Student Union***s decision to partner with the UE.
   Students have also created an information site ([40]www.uenotformit.org)
   that outlines their reservations about the UE, concluding, ***There is no
   need for us to bind ourselves to an organization that we would be
   financially supporting, but which would tie our hands in decisions of
   policy and actively seek to undermine research in various fields.***

   Q: On its website, the UE calls for ***a moratorium on the construction of
   any additional nuclear fission power plants.*** What does that mean for
   MIT graduate students in nuclear science and engineering?

   A: **We don***t yet know how these policy positions might impact potential
   future bargaining between MIT and a graduate student union. The initial
   decisions about what the union might ask for in bargaining would be up to
   the union and its membership.

   Q: I***ve heard that the UE has taken a position of ***Boycott, Divestment
   and Sanctions (BDS)*** against Israel in connection with the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What does this mean, and what can I do if I
   have concerns about this?

   A: The UE***s position on ***Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)*** is
   referenced [41]here, and other UE policy stances are available [42]here.
   We have received information suggesting that some graduate students are
   uncomfortable with the UE***s BDS position.

   MIT has no role, and will not have any role, in setting union policies. We
   encourage all graduate students to review these policy positions as part
   of making fully informed decisions about whether to support or join a
   union aligned with the UE.

   Q: I***m a graduate student who opposes the unionization effort. What am I
   allowed to do?

   A: Graduate students who oppose the unionization effort have the same
   rights as those who support the union, and are entitled to take steps to
   organize and make their viewpoints heard. For example, consistent with MIT
   policies, graduate students who oppose the union may set up meetings with
   other students, create and promote websites explaining their positions,
   put up posters, hand out leaflets, talk to the press, and generally use
   all the same communication channels as the student organizers who support
   the union. Students might also consider researching graduate student
   unionization activities at other universities, and the steps taken by
   students who supported or opposed those unionization efforts.

   Q: Can MIT provide any support to graduate students who oppose the
   unionization effort?

   A: MIT is not permitted to provide support to graduate students who oppose
   the unionization effort, or to those who support it. However, consistent
   with MIT***s policies, every graduate student has the right to express
   their views on this topic and is permitted to make their viewpoints heard.

   Q: I***ve heard that MIT filed an anti-union brief in court a few years
   ago. What***s the background on that?

   A: In 2016, MIT joined eight other research universities in filing a
   ***friend of the court*** brief with the National Labor Relations Board
   (NLRB), asking that the NLRB follow its 2004 decision involving Brown
   University. In that decision, the NLRB concluded that graduate assistants
   are students, not employees.

   MIT joined this brief because the Institute believes that its relationship
   with its graduate teaching and research assistants is substantially an
   educational one, and that unionization of graduate students may not be the
   most constructive approach to the multifaceted relationship between the
   student and the Institute.

   In the 2016 case, the NLRB overturned its 2004 position, ruling that
   graduate assistants can be both students and employees. While MIT joined
   this brief with several peer institutions, the Institute accepts and
   respects the NLRB ruling and fully supports the right of students to make
   independent decisions on whether to support unionization.

   Q: What other opinions have been shared regarding the current unionization
   effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization effort
   on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The Tech:

     o October 28, 2021: [43]***A $6,000 bill and inadequate coverage: How
       MIT health insurance fails graduate workers***
     o November 3, 2021: [44]***Director of MIT Medical responds to ***How
       MIT health insurance fails graduate workers******
     o November 9, 2021: [45]***Institute for Work and Employment Research
       faculty comment on potential graduate student unionization***

  GENERAL INFORMATION ON UNIONS AND THE UNIONIZATION PROCESS

   Q: What is the NLRB?

   A: The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is a federal agency created
   to enforce the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), a federal law to
   protect the rights of employees and employers. The law protects the rights
   of employees to choose or reject union representation.

   Q: What is a union?

   A: A union, or labor organization, is any organization or association of
   any kind in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose,
   in whole or in part, of dealing with employers on wages, benefits, hours,
   grievances or other terms or conditions of employment. A union that
   represents a majority of employees in an ***appropriate bargaining
   unit,*** and that has been certified by the NLRB following an election or
   voluntarily recognized by an employer, serves as the representative of
   that bargaining unit on all such matters involving wages, hours, and other
   terms and conditions of employment. An appropriate bargaining unit is a
   group of employees who share a clear and identifiable community of
   interest sufficient to be represented by a union.

   A union that has been certified by the NLRB, or that has been voluntarily
   recognized by an employer, negotiates a contract (also known as a
   collective bargaining agreement) on behalf of the bargaining unit to
   establish the terms and conditions of employment, including such things as
   wages, hours of work, benefits, and other working conditions. A union also
   represents its members when disputes arise over the terms of the contract.

   Q: What are union dues?

   A: Dues are the cost of membership in a union. They are used to cover the
   costs of negotiating a contract, contract administration and resolutions
   of grievances (claims of breach of contract). In addition, unions also use
   dues for the purpose of organizing employees at other employers, and to
   make political contributions.

   Q: What is the election process to form a union?

   A: The election process is conducted and supervised by representatives of
   the NLRB. An election is typically held within approximately three or four
   weeks after the filing of a representation petition by the union, but the
   timing may differ depending upon how the NLRB treats outstanding
   bargaining unit issues, and how long it takes to resolve those issues.
   Once an election date is set, secret ballot voting would likely take place
   in a central location at a designated date and time, or by a mail-in
   process, as determined by the NLRB.

   The election outcome is determined by a simple majority of those who
   actually vote, not by a majority of all eligible voters. Union
   representation will be determined by voters, and will be binding on both
   voters and non-voters in the proposed bargaining unit. Therefore, it is
   important that all members of a proposed bargaining unit vote, even if
   they are not interested in unionization.

   Those who have already signed membership or authorization cards are not
   obligated to vote in favor of the union during the secret ballot election:
   They are free to change their mind. Once a petition is filed with the
   NLRB, and the showing of interest is confirmed, membership or
   authorization cards usually serve no further purpose.

   Q: What does the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) say regarding
   negotiations?

   A: Section 8(d) of the NLRA states:

   For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the
   performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the
   representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in
   good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of
   employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising
   thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any
   agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does
   not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a
   concession.

   Q: Is anything required to be in a collective bargaining agreement?

   A: No, the NLRA does not require that any particular right or provision be
   part of a contract. Collective bargaining agreements normally have
   provisions on compensation and benefits, workload and assignments, hours
   of work, grievance procedures and a variety of other provisions, but no
   particular provisions are mandated by law. You may find some contracts
   have a particular provision but another contract might not *** it all
   depends on what those parties have chosen to include in their agreements.
   The law requires good-faith negotiations over mandatory subjects of
   bargaining. However, the law specifically does not require either party to
   make a particular concession or to agree to a particular proposal during
   negotiations.

   Q: What might be covered in a union contract?

   A: The NLRA requires employers and unions to bargain collectively over
   ***wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.*** These
   are called mandatory subjects of bargaining, over which the parties
   mustnegotiate.

   Other topics of interest that do not fall under the umbrella of mandatory
   negotiations might be addressed by the parties as ***permissive***
   subjects *** topics over which neither side is required to negotiate.
   Items such as the hiring process and housing costs would fall into that
   category. The NLRB has not yet addressed with any specificity what
   ***terms and conditions of employment*** are in the graduate student
   context. In a case involving Columbia University graduate students, the
   NLRB stated that academic decisions remain the prerogative of the
   university, but what constitutes an academic versus a non-academic
   decision is not yet clear.

   There may be many issues of importance to our students that would not be
   considered mandatory subjects of bargaining under the law, such as
   concerns about student housing.

   Some guidance about the terms and conditions that may be addressed in a
   contract can be gleaned from examining other graduate student contracts.
   For example, the contract between Harvard University and its graduate
   student teaching and research assistants represented by the United Auto
   Workers (UAW) covers numerous terms and conditions of employment such as
   salaries, benefits, working hours, and grievance procedures;
   nondiscrimination provisions; leaves of absence; job postings; and access
   to offices.

   However, many rights are retained by Harvard. In the Harvard contract with
   the UAW, the university retains the exclusive right to determine and
   control the university***s mission, objectives, priorities, operations,
   and resources, among many other rights. Harvard also retains the right to
   control ***all matters of academic judgment and decision-making, including
   ***who is taught, what is taught, how it is taught and who does the
   teaching.****** All matters affecting research methodology and materials,
   and external grants including application, selection, funding,
   administration, usage, accountability, and termination are also retained
   by Harvard.

   Also, there are great variations in union contracts because it is up to
   the parties to those contracts to decide what they will agree to and what
   they will not. The appearance of a clause in one contract *** no matter
   what it is *** does not guarantee that it will appear in an MIT contract
   if the union were to be elected.

   Q: How many graduate student union contracts are there around the country?

   A: There are about 42 graduate student contracts, according to the
   National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education
   and the Professions. The majority are at public universities; there are
   only nine graduate student union contracts in the private sector, at
   American University, Brandeis University, Brown University, Columbia
   University, Georgetown University, Harvard University, The New School, New
   York University, and Tufts University.

   Q: Does the UE represent graduate students anywhere else?

   A: To the best of our knowledge, the only contract they currently have in
   place is at the University of Iowa.

   Q: Are state labor laws different from the NLRA?

   A: Yes. In many cases, state and federal laws differ significantly when it
   comes to issues such as bargaining topics, negotiation impasse procedures,
   the right to strike, and required union membership. For example, strikes
   are prohibited under most state laws, making strikes rare at public
   universities, but strikes are legal in the private sector.

   Many state laws also, for example, specify what issues are considered
   ***terms and conditions of employment,*** and therefore subject to
   collective bargaining, and what issues are ***academic,*** and therefore
   not subject to collective bargaining. Federal law is not tailored to
   address the issues of academic and educational matters related to graduate
   student activities.

   Q: How long do student union contract negotiations typically take? Have
   students represented by unions at other universities gone on strike?

   A: [46]A June 2021 Bloomberg Law analysis estimated that, on average, it
   takes 409 days for new unions and their employers to sign their first
   collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The analysis is depicted in the
   following chart:

   The table below provides examples of the length of student union contract
   negotiations at other institutions of higher education based on available
   information, and also notes when student-authorized strikes have taken

   * Negotiations began in October 2018 and ended in June 2020, and included
   a 29-day strike in December 2019. The parties initially agreed only to a
   one-year contract, which expired on June 30, 2021. The parties agreed to a
   second contract, which was ratified in November 2021, with 70.6 percent of
   voters in support of the new deal, and after a three-day strike and the
   threat of a second strike.

   ** Columbia University has not yet reached an initial agreement with its
   union. The NLRB election was held in December 2016; the NLRB issued its
   decision certifying the union on December 16, 2017. Negotiations for a
   first contract started in February 2019 and a tentative agreement was
   reached in April 2021 but was voted down by union members. In July 2021,
   union members elected a new union bargaining committee after all 10
   members of the union***s bargaining committee stepped down. In September
   2021, union members authorized a strike and on November 3, 2021, the
   strike commenced.

   *** Bargaining began in [77]September 2017; strike in 5/2018 following 63+
   bargaining sessions.

       Grad student unionization update: NLRB sets election for April 4-5

   February 28, 2022

   Dear Colleagues,

   Earlier this evening, we sent the below email to all graduate students to
   let them know about the April 4-5 NLRB-run election to determine whether a
   little over half of MIT graduate students will form a union.

   The outcome of this election will have profound and long-term impacts on
   all of our current and future graduate students and could alter the ways
   that they interact with all of you.

   With this in mind, as the April 4-5 election is just about one month away,
   we strongly encourage you to ask your students to take the time to learn
   about this process by carefully weighing the positions of [13]MIT's
   leadership, the [14]MIT graduate students who are opposed to the United
   Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), and the [15]MIT
   graduate students who are working with the UE. And of course, when the
   time comes, please encourage them to vote.

   If you have any questions, please direct them to
   [16]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

   Ian A. Waitz
   Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate and Graduate Education

Highlights

     o April 4-5 will be the dates for an NLRB-run election to decide whether
       some MIT graduate students will form a union affiliated with the
       United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE).
     o The proposed union now includes about 3,750 of MIT's 7,000 graduate
       students: The UE has decided to exclude the rest, including all
       students funded solely by fellowships.
     o With the election set, MIT is now required to provide the UE and NLRB
       with email and home addresses, as well as phone numbers, for all
       graduate students in the potential bargaining unit.
     o MIT's leaders urge all eligible students to vote in this secret-ballot
       election: The outcome will be determined by a simple majority of those
       who vote, but will be binding on both voters and non-voters in the
       proposed bargaining unit, as well as future MIT students.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students,

   We write to share the news that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
   has set April 4-5 as the dates for its on-campus election to determine
   whether some 3,750 of MIT's graduate students will form a union associated
   with the [17]United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE).

   We are pleased that election dates have been set. We feel it's
   fundamentally important that every eligible graduate student be given the
   opportunity to make their voice heard on this important matter.

   Over the course of this month, the UE has scaled back its proposed
   bargaining unit, which now includes about 3,750 of MIT's 7,000 graduate
   students. As we noted in our [18]letter yesterday, the UE excluded more
   than 2,000 students from its bargaining unit in its initial filing earlier
   this month with the NLRB. Then, in recent days, the UE decided to remove
   900 graduate students on full MIT fellowships. The union has said that the
   NLRB will make a ruling on these students after the election. That is
   inaccurate. All fellows have been excluded and are not part of the UE's
   proposed bargaining unit.

   These developments underscore the realities of graduate student
   unionization, and the limitations of the collective bargaining process
   that the UE seeks to put in place at MIT:

     o Collective bargaining seldom entails one side getting everything it
       wants. In this case, to make gains toward its goal of an election
       early this spring, the UE made concessions on which students to
       include in its proposed union.
     o The UE's proposed union won't serve or represent all of our graduate
       students. Under our collaborative model, graduate students have always
       had a secure seat at MIT's table on issues affecting them, and all
       students have an equal opportunity to voice their priorities. But if
       the UE's union is put in place, it will divide our graduate student
       population almost in half. With the UE at the table, an outside party
       with almost no experience in academia will be inserted into
       negotiations on behalf of only some of our graduate students,
       bargaining on only some topics, such as stipends and work hours.


   Now that the election has been set, MIT is [19]required by federal law and
   subpoena to share personal phone numbers, email addresses, and mailing
   addresses with the UE and NLRB by Wednesday for each of the 3,750 graduate
   students who are eligible to vote. The UE will be able to use this
   personal information to assist in their campaign efforts, and those of you
   who are eligible to vote will receive information from the NLRB on voting
   in this election.

   We know that these developments may be surprising or upsetting for
   students on both sides of this debate. Some of you may have been hoping to
   vote in this election. Others may have hoped an election would not come to
   pass. We understand that there are strong views for and against
   unionization on our campus. It's important that, in the weeks leading up
   to the election, we create spaces for open, respectful dialogue about this
   consequential decision.

   As this April election comes into view, we again urge you to become as
   informed as possible. Take the time to learn about this process, so that
   you are voting with eyes wide open. Carefully weigh the positions of
   [20]MIT's leadership, the [21]MIT graduate students who are opposed to the
   UE, and the [22]MIT graduate students who are working with the UE.

   Come April, it is essential that every eligible student make it a priority
   to vote in this important election. Its outcome will be determined by a
   simple majority of those who vote, but will be binding on both voters and
   non-voters in the proposed bargaining unit.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles

                Graduate student union negotiations set to begin

   September 09, 2022

   Dear colleagues and students,

   On September 19, MIT will begin collective bargaining negotiations with
   the MIT Graduate Student Union and United Electrical, Radio, and Machine
   Workers of America (MIT GSU-UE). We write today to share an update on how
   we plan to approach these negotiations.

Commitment to good-faith negotiations & MIT's core educational and research
missions

   The MIT administration and the MIT GSU-UE share many of the same goals
   when it comes to ensuring the well-being and success of our graduate
   students.

   The upcoming negotiations, which will focus on the terms and conditions of
   employment for the members of the bargaining unit, represent an
   opportunity to find common ground in order to build on the progress we've
   been making to [13]improve the graduate student experience.

   We remain committed to bargaining in good faith. And we are hopeful that
   the road to a first contract will be as smooth and efficient as possible.

   That said, reaching an initial collective bargaining agreement between a
   graduate student union and an institution of higher education typically
   takes many months and, in some cases, years, and good faith disagreements
   between the two sides are certainly to be expected.

   Throughout the negotiations, MIT will uphold its responsibility to provide
   the best possible educational and research experiences to all students, an
   obligation that is at the heart of our mission as an academic institution.
   MIT has 12,000 students, and the union represents less than one-third of
   them. We will continue to serve the collective best interests of every
   student, both those who are represented by the union and those who are
   not, and will not agree to terms that will undermine our academic or
   research missions. Indeed, as this is a labor bargaining process, we do
   not intend to negotiate on academic matters with the union.

In closing

   In the absence of a contract, we will continue to operate our academic
   programs and all other activities as we have in the past. Once a contract
   is agreed upon, we will communicate any changes that may be necessary.

   If you have any questions in the meantime, please reach out to
   [14]gradunionquestions@mit.edu for assistance or visit
   [15]grad-union.mit.edu for information about the bargaining process.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles, Chancellor

   Cynthia Barnhart, Provost

                     NLRB sets April 4-5 as election dates

   February 28, 2022

Highlights

     o April 4-5 will be the dates for an NLRB-run election to decide whether
       some MIT graduate students will form a union affiliated with the
       United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE).
     o The proposed union now includes about 3,750 of MIT's 7,000 graduate
       students: The UE has decided to exclude the rest, including all
       students funded solely by fellowships.
     o With the election set, MIT is now required to provide the UE and NLRB
       with email and home addresses, as well as phone numbers, for all
       graduate students in the potential bargaining unit.
     o MIT's leaders urge all eligible students to vote in this secret-ballot
       election: The outcome will be determined by a simple majority of those
       who vote, but will be binding on both voters and non-voters in the
       proposed bargaining unit, as well as future MIT students.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students,

   We write to share the news that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
   has set April 4-5 as the dates for its on-campus election to determine
   whether some 3,750 of MIT's graduate students will form a union associated
   with the [13]United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE).

   We are pleased that election dates have been set. We feel it's
   fundamentally important that every eligible graduate student be given the
   opportunity to make their voice heard on this important matter.

   Over the course of this month, the UE has scaled back its proposed
   bargaining unit, which now includes about 3,750 of MIT's 7,000 graduate
   students. As we noted in our [14]letter yesterday, the UE excluded more
   than 2,000 students from its bargaining unit in its initial filing earlier
   this month with the NLRB. Then, in recent days, the UE decided to remove
   900 graduate students on full MIT fellowships. The union has said that the
   NLRB will make a ruling on these students after the election. That is
   inaccurate. All fellows have been excluded and are not part of the UE's
   proposed bargaining unit.

   These developments underscore the realities of graduate student
   unionization, and the limitations of the collective bargaining process
   that the UE seeks to put in place at MIT:

     o Collective bargaining seldom entails one side getting everything it
       wants. In this case, to make gains toward its goal of an election
       early this spring, the UE made concessions on which students to
       include in its proposed union.
     o The UE's proposed union won't serve or represent all of our graduate
       students. Under our collaborative model, graduate students have always
       had a secure seat at MIT's table on issues affecting them, and all
       students have an equal opportunity to voice their priorities. But if
       the UE's union is put in place, it will divide our graduate student
       population almost in half. With the UE at the table, an outside party
       with almost no experience in academia will be inserted into
       negotiations on behalf of only some of our graduate students,
       bargaining on only some topics, such as stipends and work hours.


   Now that the election has been set, MIT is [15]required by federal law and
   subpoena to share personal phone numbers, email addresses, and mailing
   addresses with the UE and NLRB by Wednesday for each of the 3,750 graduate
   students who are eligible to vote. The UE will be able to use this
   personal information to assist in their campaign efforts, and those of you
   who are eligible to vote will receive information from the NLRB on voting
   in this election.

   We know that these developments may be surprising or upsetting for
   students on both sides of this debate. Some of you may have been hoping to
   vote in this election. Others may have hoped an election would not come to
   pass. We understand that there are strong views for and against
   unionization on our campus. It's important that, in the weeks leading up
   to the election, we create spaces for open, respectful dialogue about this
   consequential decision.

   As this April election comes into view, we again urge you to become as
   informed as possible. Take the time to learn about this process, so that
   you are voting with eyes wide open. Carefully weigh the positions of
   [16]MIT's leadership, the [17]MIT graduate students who are opposed to the
   UE, and the [18]MIT graduate students who are working with the UE.

   Come April, it is essential that every eligible student make it a priority
   to vote in this important election. Its outcome will be determined by a
   simple majority of those who vote, but will be binding on both voters and
   non-voters in the proposed bargaining unit.

                Where we stand on graduate student unionization

   February 27, 2022

Highlights

     o A hearing is being held this week to determine the composition of a
       proposed graduate student union at MIT, as well as the mechanics of an
       election.
     o MIT maintains that 900 graduate students on full MIT fellowships are
       students only: Unlike those who work as RAs or TAs, fellows are not
       required to provide specific services, or work on specific research
       projects, in order to maintain their funding.
     o Drawing the boundaries of a bargaining unit is essential to forming a
       union; the UE has already excluded more than 2,000 MIT graduate
       students from its proposed union.
     o Unionization would swap a collaborative, flexible model serving all
       graduate students for a rigid approach involving a third party that
       will represent only a portion of our graduate student body.
     o When the time comes for MIT's graduate students to vote, it will be
       essential that you do so after critically weighing all sides of this
       important decision.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------



   To MIT graduate students,

   Beginning tomorrow, representatives of MIT and the [13]United Electrical,
   Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) will begin participating in a
   hearing at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). These proceedings,
   [14]which required MIT to provide the UE and the NLRB with certain
   information about our graduate students, will ultimately determine the
   composition of a proposed graduate student union at MIT, as well as the
   mechanics of an election that we hope can be held this spring.

   We want to take this opportunity to reiterate [15]what we shared with you
   earlier this month: MIT's senior leaders do not believe that a graduate
   student union is the best path forward for current and future graduate
   students. Here are a few key reasons why:

     o Unionization would likely force a cumbersome one-size-fits-all
       approach on a graduate student community that is anything but
       monolithic: In MIT's case, there are 108 distinct graduate programs,
       and 7,000 unique graduate students. Our current inclusive,
       collaborative, flexible [16]model is more responsive to students'
       needs; unionization would impose a bureaucratic process that inserts a
       third party into negotiations that focus on mandatory bargaining
       items, such as stipends and work hours.
     o Collective bargaining is a process that can be slow-moving, and it's
       often contentious. In fact, in all cases involving graduate student
       unions at private universities, [17]one to four years have elapsed
       between a unionization vote and a ratified first contract. In many
       cases, strikes along the way have interrupted students' progress
       toward their degrees.
     o While neither unions nor employers can ever predict what provisions
       will be in a final collective bargaining agreement, it's important to
       compare what union organizers state they can deliver during a campaign
       with what they ultimately produce in a contract. If you review recent
       agreements at other institutions with graduate student unions,
       [18]what's included in the final contract is often considerably less
       than the unions' stated goals. It is a bargaining process.


   Last Thursday, students involved in the unionization effort [19]authored
   an op-ed in The Tech questioning MIT's position that 900 graduate students
   on full MIT fellowships should not be included in the UE's proposed
   bargaining unit. This critical topic will be a focus of this week's
   hearing.

   We encourage you to learn more about our position by reading [20]our full
   statement - which notes that the UE itself has already excluded more than
   2,000 MIT graduate students from its proposed union. It also outlines the
   similarities and differences among RAs, TAs, and fellows; explains how
   students on MIT fellowships are most akin to the students that the UE has
   already excluded; and highlights how students - especially international
   students - may lose some of the benefits of fellowships if fellows are
   included in a bargaining unit.

   While we await the outcome of this week's hearing, we urge you to take the
   time to carefully consider the full positions of [21]MIT's leadership, the
   [22]MIT graduate students who are opposed to the UE, and the [23]MIT
   graduate students who are working with the UE. When the time comes later
   this spring for MIT's graduate students to vote, it will be essential that
   you do so after critically weighing all sides of this important decision.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

                         Unionization election results

   To the members of the MIT community,

   We write to update you on the efforts by a group of MIT graduate students
   to form a union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine
   Workers of America (UE).

   Please see below a letter we sent today to our graduate students, sharing
   the results of the independent election held on our campus earlier this
   week, and conducted by the National Labor Relations Board.

   We thank those of you, on all sides of the unionization debate, who have
   engaged constructively and respectfully in this conversation. Students are
   at the heart of MIT, and all of us who lead the Institute remain dedicated
   to ensuring that every student benefits from every opportunity that our
   campus has to offer.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

Highlights

     o In this week's graduate student unionization election, 75 percent of
       MIT's 3,823 eligible graduate students cast ballots.
     o Of the counted ballots, 66 percent were votes in favor of
       unionization, while 34 percent were votes against the union.
     o With the election outcome now clear, we will continue to work
       alongside you to improve MIT for all of our students.
     o We congratulate the current and past members of the MIT Graduate
       Student Union (MIT GSU) on their four years of dedicated work that
       culminated in this election.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students,

   The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has counted the ballots from the
   graduate student unionization election held on our campus earlier this
   week -- an election in which 75 percent of the 3,823 eligible graduate
   students cast ballots.

   Of the counted ballots, 1,785 students (66 percent) voted in favor of
   representation by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of
   America (UE), while 912 students (34 percent) voted against the union.

   We are grateful to the many members of our community, on all sides of the
   debate, who have engaged constructively and respectfully in this
   conversation. Throughout this process, we have been heartened by our
   community's clear commitment to the well-being and success of our
   students.

   Indeed, as we wrote to you during this campaign: We agree that there are
   areas where MIT can improve, and we share many of the same goals as the
   MIT Graduate Student Union. With the election outcome now clear, we will
   continue to work alongside you to improve MIT for all of our students. And
   we congratulate the current and past members of the MIT GSU on their four
   years of dedicated work that culminated in this election.

   In light of the outcome of this vote, in the coming months, MIT's
   representatives expect to meet with MIT GSU and UE leaders to begin
   good-faith negotiations over the terms and conditions of employment for
   the members of this bargaining unit.

   Of course, the Institute must serve all of its students, in every school
   and academic program. MIT has 12,000 students, and the union will
   represent less than one-third of them. We will continue to uphold our
   responsibility to every student, both those who are represented by the
   union and those who are not.

   Students are at the heart of MIT, and all of us who lead the Institute are
   dedicated to ensuring that every student benefits from every opportunity
   that our campus has to offer. We look forward to continuing that work
   together with you.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

                      What you need to know before voting

   April 03, 2022

Highlights

     o Voting will take place in Walker Memorial (Building 50) on both Monday
       and Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2:30 to 3:30 p.m., and 5:30 to 8:30
       p.m.
     o MIT, the UE, and the MIT GSU will NOT know how you vote: This is an
       independent, secret-ballot election run by the National Labor
       Relations Board (NLRB).
     o Per NLRB policies, you will need to wear a mask while voting, and only
       in-person voting is allowed: The NLRB has not permitted absentee
       voting in this election.
     o This election will be determined by a simple majority of those who
       vote; it does not require support from a majority of the 3,800
       graduate students who are eligible to vote. But if the UE wins, all
       students in the proposed bargaining unit will be represented by it.



   --------------------------------------------------------------------------



   To MIT graduate students:

   This Monday and Tuesday, we hope that all eligible voters will cast
   ballots on this question: "Do you wish to be represented by the [13]United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) for the purposes of
   collective bargaining?"

   Whatever the outcome of this election, all of us who lead MIT will
   continue to support you: We want you to thrive during your time here. Over
   the past five years, our partnerships with you have led to [14]substantial
   gains for all MIT graduate students, including:

     o Greater financial security: MIT's student-led process has delivered
       [15]higher stipends than those at all nine private universities with
       graduate student unions.
     o Support for your health and wellness: MIT Medical offers robust
       [16]health and dental insurance, with health insurance premiums that
       are [17]on par with or less than those at our peers.
     o Protection for international students: MIT's actions helped its
       international students weather the pandemic, and protected them from
       [18]shifting federal immigration policies.
     o Unity and growth: MIT has [19]worked to build a more inclusive,
       supportive, and diverse community; fight harassment; and foster
       students' personal and professional growth.

   Your decision now is whether to exchange the process that led to these
   improvements, and [20]many others, for a new approach rooted in labor
   bargaining. But beyond gains on stipends -- an area where MIT is already a
   leader -- graduate student unions at peer institutions have failed to
   deliver on many key campaign promises or demands, despite lengthy
   negotiations and multiple strikes. For example, at both [21]Harvard and
   [22]Columbia, unions made promises on graduate housing and support for
   international students. But because there are limits in applying a labor
   relations process to a graduate student body, newly ratified contracts at
   both Harvard and Columbia have provided few gains on these important
   issues.

   Unionization and affiliation with the UE -- which now represents graduate
   students at only one university, the University of Iowa -- could also
   carry risks and costs for MIT students:

     o The risk of strikes and slow progress: Columbia's graduate student
       union took [23]more than five years to reach a first contract, with
       students spending a total of 132 days on strike -- an approach that
       [24]UE policy calls "the primary weapon against the employer."
     o Continued UE pressure on students: Some of you have reported facing
       pressure from UE supporters, both inside and outside MIT, during this
       campaign; such behavior may persist even after a union is in place.
     o Costly union dues: Union members may pay UE dues of up to $550 per
       year, without any guarantee of better benefits or compensation. And
       like the graduate student unions at Harvard and Columbia, the UE would
       likely demand a contract provision requiring all members of the
       bargaining unit to pay dues or fees to the UE.
     o A new political entity on campus: The UE is a national organization
       with [25]its own political and financial interests, and can use member
       dues to advance these interests. MIT students have [26]raised concerns
       about the UE's policy positions on topics such as nuclear power and
       U.S. support of Ukraine and Israel. Students have also [27]questioned
       the UE's finances, as well as MIT's voting power within the national
       organization.
     o The UE will impact student-advisor relationships -- [28]the vast
       majority of which are positive. A number of faculty have [29]shared
       their reservations publicly: "I see a graduate student union as a
       mechanism for opposition between students and MIT," [30]one wrote. "If
       we are opponents, then how do we continue to be full-on
       collaborators?"

   With this information in hand, consider how you would answer these
   questions:

   Has the UE made the case that you are better off exchanging MIT's track
   record of real successes on behalf of all of its graduate students for the
   campaign promises of a national union that has almost no experience
   working with universities?

   Has the UE provided sufficient, rigorous evidence to support its claims?

   Does the UE share your values? A vote for the UE is a vote in support of
   their [31]policies.

   And finally, the question you will be asked when you vote -- the one with
   lasting implications for current and future graduate students, since
   unions don't stand for re-election: Do you wish to be represented by the
   UE for the purposes of collective bargaining?

   We thank you for your attention to [32]our messages during this campaign.
   We urge you to vote this week, whether you support or oppose the union.
   And whatever the outcome, we look forward to continuing to work with you,
   and your student representatives, in support of your education at MIT.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

               Important update on graduate student unionization

   February 01, 2022

   To the members of the MIT community,

   We write to update you on efforts by a group of MIT graduate students to
   form a union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine
   Workers of America (UE).

   Please see below a letter we sent earlier today to our graduate students,
   sharing the news that all eligible graduate students will be given the
   opportunity to decide on unionization through an independent election
   conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. This is the latest step
   in a process set in motion last September, when the union organizers
   publicly launched their campaign.

   We respect the right of graduate students to review their options and to
   make their own decisions about whether unionization and affiliation with
   the UE is in their best interest.

   However, we do not believe that unionization is the most constructive path
   forward for our graduate students. Today's letter to graduate students
   explains that position. For those who are interested in learning more, we
   invite you to visit [13]grad-union.mit.edu, created to help every graduate
   student cast an informed vote on this important issue.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

Letter to graduate students

Highlights

     o MIT has declined a request to recognize a graduate student union
       without an election: "All eligible students should have the chance to
       choose for themselves."
     o Institute senior leaders do not believe a graduate student union will
       produce better, or quicker, outcomes for students: "Promises about
       what collective bargaining can deliver have been overstated."
     o At MIT, we solve problems best together, and our longstanding model
       for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic, and
       effective.
     o All graduate students should cast an informed vote after considering
       both sides in this debate and visiting [14]grad-union.mit.edu.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students,

   As you have likely heard, some MIT graduate students are seeking to form a
   union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of
   America (UE). Union organizers have now filed a petition with the National
   Labor Relations Board (NLRB), requesting an election to determine if
   eligible graduate students will be represented by a union.

   Last month, the Institute declined the UE's request to recognize such a
   union without an election. MIT's senior leaders believe that all eligible
   students should have the chance to choose for themselves, through an
   independent election, whether unionization is in their best interests.

   In recent months, the UE has shared its views via social media, press
   releases, and op-eds -- but no one can make an informed choice having
   heard only one side. We write to you now to share MIT's senior leaders'
   perspective on graduate student unionization; highlight what's at stake in
   this election; and to convey why, when the time comes, it's critical that
   you vote.

Making an informed choice

   Here are a few of the most important reasons why we believe that MIT's
   longstanding partnership with graduate students is a better path forward
   than unionization:

     o As students attending MIT to learn and to earn a graduate degree, your
       connection to the Institute is broader than an employee/employer
       relationship. But beyond wages, benefits, hours, and other
       straightforward terms and conditions of employment, there are many
       issues that collective bargaining is not well-suited to resolve.

       Unfortunately, promises about what collective bargaining can deliver
       have been overstated and the burdens you could face if the union is
       successful have been understated: a bureaucratic, lengthy labor
       bargaining process; the potential cost of dues; and the detrimental
       effect that strikes and other disruptions may have on your learning
       and research.

       At MIT, we solve problems best together, and [15]our longstanding
       model for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic,
       and effective. Your seat at the table is established and secure, and
       [16]yields real results -- on issues including stipends, student
       support, medical benefits, immigration matters, transitional funding,
       and fostering a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse community.

       This existing structure serves all graduate students, and reflects the
       fact that your connections with MIT are nuanced, varied, and in most
       cases, exceptionally rewarding. It also provides more flexibility than
       a union could in responding to graduate students' varied needs across
       an institution as diverse as ours.


     o Finally, once installed, labor unions are essentially permanent.
       Unions do not stand for re-election. This is not an experiment: When
       you cast your vote, you are making a choice not only on behalf of
       current students, but also the many thousands of graduate students who
       will succeed you over the decades.


Building a better MIT together

   Like every institution, MIT will always have room for improvement. Those
   of us who have devoted our lives to MIT, and to making it a place of
   excellence and belonging for generations of our students, are deeply aware
   that we must always strive to do better.

   While we acknowledge that there is always more to be done, we are proud of
   the significant progress we have made in recent years, thanks to our
   collaboration with graduate student leaders. We have serious concerns that
   a graduate student union aligned with the UE will not be able to build on
   these successes and produce better outcomes for you.

   Those of us who lead MIT are personally invested in your success -- and
   having been graduate students ourselves, we understand the challenges you
   face. No matter the election outcome, we will continue to work alongside
   you both to help you succeed academically and to make MIT better for all
   of our students.

   We will have more to say in the coming weeks, and we will share details
   about how you can vote once the NLRB has set the election. As a starting
   point, though, we encourage you to visit [17]grad-union.mit.edu, and to
   discuss this very important decision with your fellow students. There is
   much for you to consider, and a lot is riding on your decision.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles

                        Risks and costs of unionization

   March 24, 2022

Highlights

     o A decision to form a union carries potential risks, losses, and costs.
     o Strikes are a reality with graduate student unions: The UE calls for
       the use of strikes as "the primary weapon against the employer";
       Columbia's student union secured a contract after five years and 132
       days on strike.
     o MIT's nimble, student-driven stipend process is able to deliver much
       stronger results in a high-inflation environment than union-negotiated
       contracts at Harvard or Columbia.
     o Union members may pay dues of up to $550 per year, without any
       guarantee of better compensation or benefits.
     o A union would change campus dynamics, adding the UE as a new entity
       with its own political and financial interests; the UE and local union
       leadership may continue to access and use students' personal
       information even after a victory.
     o Some faculty are questioning how student-advisor relationships would
       be impacted, concerned that unionization "reduces flexibility in favor
       of a highly structured relationship."


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students:

   On April 4 and 5, many of you will participate in a confidential
   [13]election to decide whether the [14]United Electrical, Radio & Machine
   Workers of America (UE) will represent you for collective bargaining.

   We've previously described [15]our position, the [16]limits of
   unionization and labor bargaining in graduate education, and the [17]gains
   won for all MIT graduate students through our current collaborative
   processes. Today we share some of the risks, losses, and costs that
   graduate students might face if a union is elected:

     o The risk of strikes and disruptions: Strikes and delays can occur
       during contract negotiations. In fact, the [18]UE's policy book
       2021-2023 calls for "the continued use of the strike as the primary
       weapon against the employer."

       It took Columbia's student union more than five years to reach a first
       contract following its election, and students were on strike for a
       total of 132 days during this period. [19]In all cases, between 475
       and 1,504 days elapsed before a first contract was reached between
       student unions and private universities, and strikes are very possible
       during negotiations, putting academic progress at risk and important
       financial and policy improvements on hold.

     o The likely loss of a nimble, responsive, and student-driven stipend
       process: Harvard and Columbia's students are now locked into
       multi-year, union-negotiated contracts with 3 percent increases in the
       out years. By contrast, [20]our student-led process considers
       cost-of-living increases on an annual basis, and is responsive to
       high-inflation pressures such as those that exist today. As a result
       of this process, MIT's stipends are already higher than those at
       nearly every private university that has a graduate student union.

     o Costly union dues: Union members may pay dues of up to $550 per year,
       without any guarantee of better benefits or compensation.


   The UE and its supporters in the [21]MIT Graduate Student Union argue that
   a union would change campus for the better. It may also change it for the
   worse:

     o The UE would introduce a third-party entity on campus: The UE is a
       national organization with [22]its own political and financial
       interests, which may or may not align with yours. The UE can use
       member dues to advance these interests, including supporting its
       broader national organization, which is [23]something students opposed
       to the UE have raised concerns about. In addition to the UE's national
       political agenda, the new local union leadership would likely have its
       own priorities that you may or may not agree with.

     o The UE would be able to pressure students, and may continue to use
       students' personal information, even after a victory: We've received
       reports during this campaign of students feeling pressured by union
       supporters. Unfortunately, behavior like this is likely to persist if
       the UE is successful. The union would need to seek new student
       members, garner student support for their bargaining and political
       positions, and likely need to persuade students to strike. And it
       would still be able to access [24]personal contact information that
       MIT was required to produce last month. (Students may contact our
       [25]Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office or
       [26]Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (OSCCS) if they
       have experienced any conduct that violates MIT policy).

     o The UE will impact student-advisor relationships: We know that [27]the
       overwhelming majority of graduate students have a positive view of the
       quality of academic advising and guidance as well as their
       interactions with faculty.

       Institute Professor Phillip Sharp and Professor Alan Grossman have
       authored [28]an op-ed in The Tech about the consequences a union would
       have on student-advisor relationships. Among their observations: "a
       unionized environment...reduces flexibility in favor of a highly
       structured relationship between manager and workers. We believe that
       such industry-framed relationships are ill-suited to the nature of and
       rapidly evolving opportunities in graduate education, where
       individuality and flexibility are necessary to foster a dynamic
       trajectory for graduate students".


   Every eligible student [29]should critically assess the different
   positions in this debate and vote on April 4 or 5 in Morss Hall, Walker
   Memorial (Building 50). This election's outcome will be determined by a
   simple majority of those who vote, but will be binding on everyone in the
   [30]proposed bargaining unit -- even if you don't vote, or don't want a
   union.

                             Our successes together

   March 08, 2022

Highlights

     o MIT's partnership with the GSC and other student representatives has
       led to many substantive improvements for graduate students over the
       past five years.
     o MIT's stipend increases have outpaced those at nearly all private
       universities with graduate student unions.
     o MIT has invested in students with the most pressing needs, allocating
       more funds for those with families, those on short-term appointments,
       and those in need of longer-term support.
     o MIT has provided enhanced health and wellness support, and MIT Medical
       continues to offer excellent, low-cost, robust health insurance
       options.
     o MIT has championed its international students, helping them to weather
       the pandemic and stepping up to protect them against challenges from
       shifting federal immigration policies.
     o MIT has worked directly with students to build a more inclusive,
       supportive, and diverse community; expand support networks for
       graduate students; combat harassment; and foster the personal and
       professional growth of its students.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students:

   By now you may have seen additional details on the upcoming NLRB-run
   election, on April 4 and 5, to determine whether some of MIT's graduate
   students will form a union associated with the [13]United Electrical,
   Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). More information is available
   at [14]grad-union.mit.edu.

   Whatever the outcome of this election, all of us who lead MIT will
   continue to support every one of our extraordinarily talented students.
   Like every institution, we will always have room for improvement. Those of
   us who have devoted our lives to MIT, and to making it a place of
   excellence and belonging for generations of our students, are deeply aware
   that we must always strive to do better. We respect and admire all of our
   graduate students, and are committed to ensuring that each of you thrives
   during your time here.

   Indeed, it is our deep interest in your work and success that has led us
   to embrace roles in student support and academic life, rather than
   focusing solely on our teaching and research. And it's why we're invested
   in strengthening MIT's uniquely effective collaboration with its student
   leaders -- an approach that has been advocated by the Institute's student
   community, is in keeping with MIT's spirit and values, and informs MIT's
   work to create a more caring and supportive environment for everyone.

   Over the past five years, our direct partnership with graduate student
   leaders, including the Graduate Student Council (GSC) and other
   representatives, has led to many substantive improvements for graduate
   students, including:

     o Greater financial security for all students: MIT's
       cost-of-living-based stipend increases -- part of a process led by the
       GSC -- have outpaced those at nearly all private universities with
       graduate student unions. Throughout the pandemic, MIT offered its
       students generous assistance with housing costs, moving expenses, and
       other financial burdens.
     o MIT has invested in students with the most pressing needs: The
       Institute has introduced new programs through which we have allocated
       approximately $1 million in grants for graduate students with
       families, students on short-term appointments, and doctoral students
       needing longer-term support.
     o MIT has provided enhanced health and wellness support: MIT Medical
       continues to offer excellent, robust [15]health insurance options with
       premiums that are [16]on par with or less expensive than our peers,
       and has expanded copay-free access to behavioral health care outside
       of MIT Medical from 12 visits to 52 visits per year.
     o MIT has championed its international students: In 2020, MIT joined
       with Harvard University in [17]successfully filing suit against the US
       Department of Homeland Security to rescind a federal policy that would
       have barred international students on F-1 visas from taking a full
       online course load while studying in the United States. And to help
       manage the challenges that the pandemic presented for its
       international graduate students, MIT allocated $5.8 million to
       facilitate roughly 1,300 remote international appointments. This
       ensured that students did not face interruptions to their academic and
       research progress, and were able to continue their studies and
       research from abroad.
     o MIT has worked to build a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse
       community: It has [18]hired school-based diversity deans; increased
       staffing in the [19]International Students Office, [20]Career Advising
       and Professional Development, and [21]GradSupport; added an employee
       to provide dedicated support for veterans and [22]created a Grad
       Families Office; invested [23]additional resources in its Violence
       Prevention and Response and Institute Discrimination and Harassment
       Response (IDHR) offices; refined [24]anti-retaliation policies;
       implemented a new [25]guaranteed transitional funding program for
       students who change research advisors or groups; and offered
       additional [26]mentoring and harassment-prevention training.
     o MIT has fostered students' personal and professional growth: It has
       enhanced advising and training, offering more than 40 workshops and
       panels in partnership with 15 academic and administrative departments
       and developing more focused career fairs and networking opportunities.


   As we draw closer to the election on April 4-5, this is the time for you
   to become as informed as possible. Learn about the unionization process
   and what it might mean for you, so that you can cast an informed vote.
   Critically assess the positions of [27]MIT's leadership -- including our
   [28]responses to recent claims made by union supporters -- as well as
   those of the [29]MIT graduate students who are opposed to the UE, and the
   members of the [30]MIT Graduate Student Union, who are working with the
   UE.

   It is essential that every eligible student make it a priority to vote on
   April 4-5. This election's outcome will be determined by a simple majority
   of those who vote, but will be binding on both voters and non-voters in
   the [31]proposed bargaining unit.

   Melissa Nobles

           Casting an informed vote on graduate student unionization

   February 01, 2022

Highlights

     o MIT has declined a request to recognize a graduate student union
       without an election: "All eligible students should have the chance to
       choose for themselves."
     o Institute senior leaders do not believe a graduate student union will
       produce better, or quicker, outcomes for students: "Promises about
       what collective bargaining can deliver have been overstated."
     o At MIT, we solve problems best together, and our longstanding model
       for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic, and
       effective.
     o All graduate students should cast an informed vote after considering
       both sides in this debate and visiting [13]grad-union.mit.edu.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students,

   As you have likely heard, some MIT graduate students are seeking to form a
   union affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of
   America (UE). Union organizers have now filed a petition with the National
   Labor Relations Board (NLRB), requesting an election to determine if
   eligible graduate students will be represented by a union.

   Last month, the Institute declined the UE's request to recognize such a
   union without an election. MIT's senior leaders believe that all eligible
   students should have the chance to choose for themselves, through an
   independent election, whether unionization is in their best interests.

   In recent months, the UE has shared its views via social media, press
   releases, and op-eds -- but no one can make an informed choice having
   heard only one side. We write to you now to share MIT's senior leaders'
   perspective on graduate student unionization; highlight what's at stake in
   this election; and to convey why, when the time comes, it's critical that
   you vote.

Making an informed choice

   Here are a few of the most important reasons why we believe that MIT's
   longstanding partnership with graduate students is a better path forward
   than unionization:

     o As students attending MIT to learn and to earn a graduate degree, your
       connection to the Institute is broader than an employee/employer
       relationship. But beyond wages, benefits, hours, and other
       straightforward terms and conditions of employment, there are many
       issues that collective bargaining is not well-suited to resolve.

       Unfortunately, promises about what collective bargaining can deliver
       have been overstated and the burdens you could face if the union is
       successful have been understated: a bureaucratic, lengthy labor
       bargaining process; the potential cost of dues; and the detrimental
       effect that strikes and other disruptions may have on your learning
       and research.

       At MIT, we solve problems best together, and [14]our longstanding
       model for working with graduate students is collaborative, dynamic,
       and effective. Your seat at the table is established and secure, and
       [15]yields real results -- on issues including stipends, student
       support, medical benefits, immigration matters, transitional funding,
       and fostering a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse community.

       This existing structure serves all graduate students, and reflects the
       fact that your connections with MIT are nuanced, varied, and in most
       cases, exceptionally rewarding. It also provides more flexibility than
       a union could in responding to graduate students' varied needs across
       an institution as diverse as ours.


     o Finally, once installed, labor unions are essentially permanent.
       Unions do not stand for re-election. This is not an experiment: When
       you cast your vote, you are making a choice not only on behalf of
       current students, but also the many thousands of graduate students who
       will succeed you over the decades.


Building a better MIT together

   Like every institution, MIT will always have room for improvement. Those
   of us who have devoted our lives to MIT, and to making it a place of
   excellence and belonging for generations of our students, are deeply aware
   that we must always strive to do better.

   While we acknowledge that there is always more to be done, we are proud of
   the significant progress we have made in recent years, thanks to our
   collaboration with graduate student leaders. We have serious concerns that
   a graduate student union aligned with the UE will not be able to build on
   these successes and produce better outcomes for you.

   Those of us who lead MIT are personally invested in your success -- and
   having been graduate students ourselves, we understand the challenges you
   face. No matter the election outcome, we will continue to work alongside
   you both to help you succeed academically and to make MIT better for all
   of our students.

   We will have more to say in the coming weeks, and we will share details
   about how you can vote once the NLRB has set the election. As a starting
   point, though, we encourage you to visit [16]grad-union.mit.edu, and to
   discuss this very important decision with your fellow students. There is
   much for you to consider, and a lot is riding on your decision.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

                            Results versus promises

   March 15, 2022

Highlights

     o We share the goal of making MIT even better for you. Where we diverge
       with the UE and MIT GSU is on the best process for achieving our
       shared goals.
     o The decision you face in April is whether to exchange a process that
       has led to many gains for MIT graduate students with a new approach,
       rooted in labor bargaining.
     o There are limits in applying a labor relations process, which would
       involve only 54 percent of MIT graduate students, to make gains for
       all 7,000 graduate students across 108 MIT graduate programs.
     o MIT would continue to rely on our existing collaborative processes and
       would not negotiate with the UE on graduate student housing,
       curricular changes, and other subjects that are unrelated to students'
       employment at MIT and also impact students outside the proposed
       bargaining unit.
     o Recent contracts negotiated by unions at Harvard and Columbia
       delivered no significant advances on graduate student housing, and
       minimal changes on issues affecting international students.
     o Last week we wrote about recent gains from our current collaborative
       process, without a union; below we describe the limitations of a labor
       relations approach; next week we will lay out potential downsides of
       unionization for MIT graduate students.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students:

   Next month, many of you will face the following question in a confidential
   [13]election run by the National Labor Relations Board: "Do you wish to be
   represented by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America
   (UE) for the purposes of collective bargaining?"

   This campaign has underscored for us the challenges that some students
   face along their paths to an MIT degree. But listening to you, and
   learning from you, has also brought into sharp focus just how much we
   agree on: We agree that there are areas where MIT can and must improve,
   and we share the goal of making MIT even better for you. What we disagree
   with the UE and MIT Graduate Student Union (MIT GSU) on is the best
   process for achieving our shared goals.

   Last week we wrote to share an overview of the [14]successes won for all
   MIT graduate students through our work together in recent years -- gains
   in crucial areas including stipends and financial support, health and
   wellness, and progress toward our shared desire to support international
   students and build a more diverse, supportive, and inclusive community.

   The decision you will face in three weeks is whether to exchange the
   process that led to these improvements for a new approach, rooted in labor
   bargaining. But there are limits in applying a labor relations process,
   involving only 54 percent of our graduate students, to make gains for all
   7,000 graduate students across 108 MIT graduate programs.

   With the UE representing just a portion of our graduate students -- and
   because labor bargaining is primarily about the terms and conditions of
   employment -- the Institute would not negotiate with the UE on
   [15]graduate student housing, curricular changes, and other subjects that
   are unrelated to students' employment at MIT and also impact students
   outside the proposed bargaining unit. The UE and MIT GSU have made many of
   these issues central to their campaign, with promises on everything from
   [16]affordable housing to [17]expanded CPT opportunities for international
   students. But these issues are outside the bounds of what MIT believes
   that it could best address -- or would be legally required to address --
   through collective bargaining with the UE.

   Consider, too, what unions have achieved -- and failed to achieve -- at
   two peer institutions with graduate student unions: [18]Harvard University
   and [19]Columbia University. Graduate students at both universities
   ratified new union contracts in the past four months.

   In both cases, unions made promises or demands on issues pertaining to
   graduate student housing and support for international students. But at
   both [20]Harvard and [21]Columbia, they made no significant gains on
   either issue.

   We know that these topics are important to many of you. They are important
   to us too. That's why we have existing pathways to advance them through
   the [22]Graduate Housing Working Group and our [23]Task Force 2021 plans
   for graduate student professional development enhancements. Both efforts
   have benefited from the substantive input of graduate students.

   Make no mistake: We respect your right to decide whether unionization and
   affiliation with the UE is right for you. Take the time to learn about the
   issues at stake so that you are prepared to cast an informed vote on April
   4 or 5. Critically assess [24]our position -- including our [25]responses
   to recent claims made by union supporters -- as well as those of the
   [26]MIT graduate students who are opposed to the UE, and the members of
   the [27]MIT Graduate Student Union, who are working with the UE. And
   compare the promises that are being made by the UE and MIT GSU with the
   actual results achieved at peer institutions with graduate student unions.

   Every eligible student must make it a priority to vote on April 4 or 5.
   This election's outcome will be determined by a simple majority of those
   who vote, but will be binding on all students in the [28]proposed
   bargaining unit -- including those who don't vote, or who don't want a
   union.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

                    Update on graduate student unionization

   October 03, 2022

   Dear colleagues and students,

   Last week, the MIT Graduate Student Union and United Electrical, Radio,
   and Machine Workers of America (MIT GSU-UE) filed a new petition with the
   National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In the petition, the MIT GSU-UE
   seeks to add graduate students on MIT fellowships to their current
   bargaining unit. (These are fellowship students who do not also have
   partial research assistant (RA), teaching assistant (TA), or Instructor G
   appointments.)

   The Institute maintains, as it did this past spring, that these graduate
   student fellows are students only - not employees - and therefore are not
   eligible to be in the MIT GSU-UE's collective bargaining unit.

   This is because students who are on MIT fellowships receive financial
   support to pursue their academic programs. Unlike students on RA or TA
   appointments, fellows are not required to perform specific work or
   services, or work on specific research projects, as a condition of
   receiving their awards. Rather, they receive their financial support so
   long as they continue to make satisfactory academic progress. This means
   they are not employees under federal labor laws. This distinction between
   RAs/TAs and fellows also exists within federal research administration
   requirements, immigration regulations, and federal taxation rules.

   We understand the MIT GSU-UE disagrees; this is why the NLRB has been
   asked to decide this issue.

   We encourage you to read [13]MIT's full position on this matter. You will
   see we also have concerns that including fellows in the bargaining unit
   may lead to a loss of some important flexibilities that currently come
   with fellowships: more flexible treatment under federal immigration rules,
   more flexibility in research opportunities, and more flexibility during
   transitional funding periods.

                                     * * *

   While the NLRB holds hearings with officials from MIT and the MIT GSU-UE
   in order to address the question about fellows - a process that could take
   months - we remain committed to negotiating in good faith with the union
   over the terms and conditions of employment for student workers currently
   in the bargaining unit (RAs, TAs, and Instructor Gs). [14]As we said last
   month before these negotiations began, we are hopeful that the road to a
   first contract will be as smooth and efficient as possible.

   Please direct any questions to [15]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles, Chancellor

   Cynthia Barnhart, Provost

              Unionization election results (to graduate students)

   April 06, 2022

Highlights

     o In this week's graduate student unionization election, 75 percent of
       MIT's 3,823 eligible graduate students cast ballots.
     o Of the counted ballots, 66 percent were votes in favor of
       unionization, while 34 percent were votes against the union.
     o With the election outcome now clear, we will continue to work
       alongside you to improve MIT for all of our students.
     o We congratulate the current and past members of the MIT Graduate
       Student Union (MIT GSU) on their four years of dedicated work that
       culminated in this election.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To MIT graduate students,

   The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has counted the ballots from the
   graduate student unionization election held on our campus earlier this
   week -- an election in which 75 percent of the 3,823 eligible graduate
   students cast ballots.

   Of the counted ballots, 1,785 students (66 percent) voted in favor of
   representation by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of
   America (UE), while 912 students (34 percent) voted against the union.

   We are grateful to the many members of our community, on all sides of the
   debate, who have engaged constructively and respectfully in this
   conversation. Throughout this process, we have been heartened by our
   community's clear commitment to the well-being and success of our
   students.

   Indeed, as we wrote to you during this campaign: We agree that there are
   areas where MIT can improve, and we share many of the same goals as the
   MIT Graduate Student Union. With the election outcome now clear, we will
   continue to work alongside you to improve MIT for all of our students. And
   we congratulate the current and past members of the MIT GSU on their four
   years of dedicated work that culminated in this election.

   In light of the outcome of this vote, in the coming months, MIT's
   representatives expect to meet with MIT GSU and UE leaders to begin
   good-faith negotiations over the terms and conditions of employment for
   the members of this bargaining unit.

   Of course, the Institute must serve all of its students, in every school
   and academic program. MIT has 12,000 students, and the union will
   represent less than one-third of them. We will continue to uphold our
   responsibility to every student, both those who are represented by the
   union and those who are not.

   Students are at the heart of MIT, and all of us who lead the Institute are
   dedicated to ensuring that every student benefits from every opportunity
   that our campus has to offer. We look forward to continuing that work
   together with you.

   Sincerely,

   Melissa Nobles
   Chancellor

         How MIT's collaborative graduate student stipend process works

   March 23, 2022

Highlights

     o MIT's graduate student stipend-setting process is a hallmark process
       at MIT, and unique across all of higher education.
     o Each year, the entirely student-run GSC Stipend Committee undertakes a
       comprehensive analysis to inform their stipend increase
       recommendations.
     o Historically, the increases in stipends set by the administration have
       equaled or exceeded the yearly growth in the cost of graduate student
       living, as estimated by the committee.
     o The administration works closely with the committee and other student
       leaders to deliver on broader priorities to address the needs of all
       of our students.
     o The current stipend-setting process is nimble, ensuring that stipend
       rates are not locked in over a series of years as they could be in a
       union contract.
     o We expect to announce the new graduate student stipend rates in the
       coming weeks.


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Dear Graduate Students,

   You may have read the recent letter from the Graduate Student Council
   (GSC) Stipend & Executive Committees concerning their [13]2022-23
   recommendations for graduate student stipend increases and related
   financial support. As MIT's senior leaders, deans, and department heads
   are now discussing their stipend decision for the coming academic year, I
   wanted to take this opportunity to explain what I think is a hallmark
   process at MIT, which is unique across all of higher education. It is also
   a wonderful example of the administration working directly with graduate
   students on important matters.

   Each year, the entirely student-run GSC Stipend Committee undertakes a
   comprehensive analysis to inform their [14]stipend increase
   recommendations. Their process takes into consideration a variety of
   factors, including local housing costs, inflation rates, and financial
   packages at peer institutions. It is based in part on expenses graduate
   students report in a regular in-depth survey.

   Historically, the increases in stipends set by the administration have
   equaled or exceeded the yearly growth in the cost of graduate student
   living, as estimated by the committee.

   To be clear, while we have a goal of responding positively to the
   students' recommendations, we have not always fully adopted the
   recommendations related to competitive positioning with peers due to other
   factors related to impacts on departmental budgets, research costs, and
   constraints from our sponsors. However, [15]while the standard stipend
   rates we set serve as a floor, we give discretion to departments to
   provide higher stipends consistent with their local circumstances. As a
   result, more than half of our students get paid above the standard rate.
   The flexibility to do this, and to offer other local financial measures,
   is an important feature of our current processes.

   As a result of this direct collaborative process between the
   administration and the GSC Stipend Committee, MIT's graduate student
   stipends compare favorably to, and in nearly every case are higher than,
   the stipends at the nine private American universities with unionized
   graduate students. MIT's minimum graduate student stipends increased 3.25%
   in June 2021 (1% more than the GSC-estimated change in cost-of-living) and
   benefitted from an additional 3% mid-year increase in December 2021. We
   anticipate additional stipend increases to emerge from this year's process
   with the GSC because of inflationary pressures, competitiveness for
   students, and research competitiveness.

   It is also the case that the GSC Stipend Committee's efforts go beyond a
   single recommended number. The administration works closely with the
   student committee and other student leaders to deliver on broader
   priorities, such as alleviating financial pressure for those facing
   challenging circumstances, supporting students with children, and
   addressing the unique needs of our international students. [16]In 2019,
   the school deans committed to implementing new ways to help, including the
   creation of three sources of financial support:

     o short-term emergency funding,
     o doctoral student long-term financial hardship funding, and
     o the need-blind MIT Grant for Graduate Students with Children program
       (the base support of which was increased after the first year).


   And [17]as just announced by the provost and the executive vice president
   and treasurer, the administration's collaboration with student leaders,
   deans, and department heads has culminated in addressing the long-standing
   desire to better fund PhD students in SHASS and SA+P. All centrally funded
   doctoral students in SHASS and SA+P are now guaranteed 12-month support
   for the entire time to degree. Moreover, although not addressed by the GSC
   Stipend Committee, MIT will also now fully fund the tuition shortfall on
   NSF.

   Finally, this annual, collaborative stipend-setting process is nimble,
   ensuring that stipend rates are not locked in over a series of years as
   they could be in a union contract. In addition, there is certainty every
   year that this direct process leads to increases in stipends.

   I hope the above provides helpful context on how stipends are currently
   set working directly with student leaders. As always, I want to thank this
   year's GSC Stipend Committee for their excellent work. We expect to
   announce the new rates in the coming weeks.

   Sincerely,

   Ian A. Waitz
   Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate and Graduate Education

    2. Notice of subpoena requiring MIT to share graduate student information
       with NLRB and UE

Notice of subpoena requiring MIT to share graduate student information with NLRB
                                     and UE

   To MIT graduate students,

   Below, please find important information about MIT***s obligation to
   provide personally-identifiable information about its graduate students to
   the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the MIT Graduate Student
   Union and United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America (MIT
   GSU-UE). In the petition, the MIT GSU-UE seeks to add graduate students on
   MIT fellowships to their current bargaining unit. (These are fellowship
   students who do not also have partial research assistant (RA), teaching
   assistant (TA), or Instructor G appointments.)

   The subpoena requires MIT to provide graduate student information to the
   NLRB and MIT GSU-UE such as students*** names, departments, and
   appointment types on or before October 11th. A copy of the [10]subpoena is
   available for review.

   At this time, we do not know whether there will be an election involving
   graduate student fellows. If there is an election, the subpoena also
   requires MIT to disclose additional information about eligible voters.
   This additional information, which includes home addresses, personal email
   addresses, and home and personal telephone numbers, would be disclosed at
   a later date. Please note that, if/when this information is provided, it
   may be used by the MIT GSU-UE as part of their campaigning efforts.

Notice of disclosure under MIT policy and federal student privacy rules

   The information sought by the NLRB subpoena constitutes ***education
   records*** as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
   (***FERPA***) (20 U.S.C. ** 1232g(b)(2) and 34 C.F.R. Part 99), a federal
   law that protects the privacy of student records. Therefore, consistent
   with FERPA and [11]MIT***s policy on the privacy of student records,
   [12]MIT is notifying you about the subpoena and the Institute***s
   obligation to produce the information described above.

   There is no action required on your part. However, if you wish to seek
   protective action to prevent some or all of these disclosures, you may
   have to initiate a separate court action. You should take this step as
   soon as possible. MIT will produce the initial set of information
   requested by the subpoena no earlier than the morning of October 11.

   Please note that MIT requested and received additional time (to October
   11) to produce the requested information, so that MIT could provide this
   notice and afford students time to seek protective action. MIT may produce
   the additional, more comprehensive set of information about eligible
   voters at a later date, which would be determined by the NLRB.

   If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to
   [13]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.**

   Community members with questions about unions and unionization that are
   not addressed on this website may contact**[14]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.

    2. Student concerns about unionization

                      Student concerns about unionization

   The below FAQs present opinion pieces that students and others have
   written in opposition to forming a union aligned with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE). These FAQs also
   address questions that students have asked about the UE, and about the
   unionization process.

    Q: What have students said in opposition to the current unionization effort?

   A: Since the MIT Graduate Student Union announced its unionization effort
   on September 27, 2021, the following op-eds have appeared in The Tech:

     o March 30, 2022: [15]***An open letter on why UE and what it stands for
       cannot represent MIT graduate students***
     o March 30, 2022: [16]***Why I***m voting ***no*** to the graduate
       student union***
     o October 6, 2021: [17]***Some concerns about unionization from a
       graduate student***
     o October 21, 2021: [18]***Why we do not need a graduate student union
       at MIT***
     o November 3, 2021: [19]***The UE isn***t the union the GSU claims it
       is***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: A student-authored website and op-ed in The Tech have raised concerns
    about the UE***s finances and policy positions. What is the basis for those
    concerns?

   A: [20]The student-authored Tech piece highlights concerns about the MIT
   Graduate Student Union***s decision to partner with the UE. Students have
   also created an information site ([21]www.uenotformit.org) that outlines
   their reservations about the UE, concluding, ***There is no need for us to
   bind ourselves to an organization that we would be financially supporting,
   but which would tie our hands in decisions of policy and actively seek to
   undermine research in various fields.***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: On its website, the UE calls for ***a moratorium on the construction of
    any additional nuclear fission power plants.*** What does that mean for MIT
    graduate students in nuclear science and engineering?

   A: **We don***t yet know how these policy positions might impact potential
   future bargaining between MIT and a graduate student union. Decisions
   about what the union might ask for in bargaining would be up to the union
   and its membership.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: I***ve heard that the UE has taken a position of ***Boycott, Divestment
    and Sanctions (BDS)*** against Israel in connection with the
    Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What does this mean, and what can I do if I
    have concerns about this?

   A: See the [22]UE***s position on ***Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions
   (BDS)***, and other [23]UE policy stances. We have received information
   suggesting that some graduate students and other community members are
   uncomfortable with the UE***s BDS position.

   MIT has no role, and will not have any role, in setting union policies. We
   encourage all graduate students to review these policy positions as part
   of making fully informed decisions about whether to support or join a
   union affiliated with the UE.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: I***m a graduate student who opposes the unionization effort. What am I
    allowed to do?

   A: Graduate students who oppose the unionization effort have the same
   rights as those who support the union, and are entitled to take steps to
   organize and make their viewpoints heard. For example, consistent with MIT
   policies, graduate students who oppose the union may set up meetings with
   other students, create and promote websites explaining their positions,
   put up posters, hand out leaflets, talk to the press, and generally use
   all the same communication channels as the students who support the union.
   Students might also consider researching graduate student unionization
   activities at other universities, and the steps taken by students at those
   universities who opposed those unionization efforts.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: Can MIT provide any support to graduate students who oppose the
    unionization effort?

   A: MIT is not permitted to provide support to graduate students who oppose
   the unionization effort, or to students who support the union. However,
   consistent with MIT policies, every graduate student has the right to
   express their views on this topic and is permitted to make their
   viewpoints heard.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: I***ve heard that MIT filed an anti-union brief in court a few years ago.
    Is that true?

   A: In 2016, MIT joined eight other research universities in filing a
   ***friend of the court*** brief with the National Labor Relations Board
   (NLRB), asking that the NLRB follow its 2004 decision involving Brown
   University. In that decision, the NLRB concluded that graduate assistants
   are primarily students, not employees, and had no rights under the
   National Labor Relations Act.

   MIT joined this brief because the Institute believes that its relationship
   with its graduate teaching and research assistants is substantially an
   educational one, and that unionization of graduate students is not the
   most constructive approach to the multifaceted relationship between the
   student and the Institute.

   In the 2016 case, the NLRB overturned its 2004 position, ruling that
   graduate assistants can be both students and employees. While MIT joined
   this brief with several peer institutions, the Institute accepts and
   respects the NLRB ruling and fully supports the right of graduate students
   to make fully informed decisions on whether to support unionization.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

    2. Fact-checking claims about unionization

                    Fact-checking claims about unionization

   The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) can promise
   whatever it wants during a unionization campaign, but it cannot guarantee
   that it will be able to back up these promises. It is essential that,
   before voting, all graduate students become fully informed about the
   issues at stake, so that each student can make their own determination
   about what***s in their best interest.

   Becoming fully informed requires that each student assess the validity of
   assertions being made about unionization, and to weigh the potential
   benefits and costs of unionization. What follows is a fact check of some
   common claims.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 28, 2022

   CLAIM: A recent [15]post by the MIT GSU states: MIT Medical***s decision
   to close the MIT Pharmacy ***decreases the ability for rapid treatment and
   leaves students with only external vendors for filling prescriptions ***
   which have higher co-pays with our insurance plan.*** The post also claims
   that the ***MIT admin has a long history of ignoring our healthcare needs,
   as well as lowering our existing healthcare access and coverage: denying
   full dental coverage, retracting health insurance coverage terms.***
   **
   FACT CHECK: Same-day prescription deliveries are available to MIT
   community members via [16]Capsule *** a pharmacy service that delivers
   directly to homes and campus residences within hours of orders being
   placed. Further, if you have filled a prescription at the MIT Pharmacy
   after March 1, 2021, and you fill a new prescription at any in-network
   pharmacy after March 25, 2022, you will be refunded any difference in
   price through the end of the insurance plan year, December 31, 2022.
   **
   More broadly, as outlined in [17]this op-ed that appeared in The Tech on
   November 3, 2021, MIT offers graduate students competitive and reasonably
   priced health and dental insurance, provides generous support for students
   facing medical and other financial hardships, and works collaboratively
   with students to improve our delivery of medical services. Additionally,
   [18]emergency medical funding for graduate students is available.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 17, 2022

   CLAIM: In a recent Tech [19]op-ed authored by GSU members *** ***Without a
   union, MIT is failing GRAs and undergraduates alike*** *** the authors
   state: ***With a union, GRAs and all other graduate students will have the
   collective power we need to resolve our [housing] issues.*** This implies
   that all GRAs (and potentially undergraduates) are in the proposed
   bargaining unit and are eligible to vote. It also implies that MIT will
   negotiate with the UE (instead of working through our current processes)
   over matters related to graduate student housing if the union is elected.
   **
   FACT CHECK: Graduate students who have only a GRA appointment are not part
   of the UE***s proposed unit. Only those GRAs with a separate RA, TA, or
   Instructor G appointment (i.e., those employed to provide instructional or
   research services), as per the NLRB***s voter eligibility requirements
   (below), are part of the proposed bargaining unit and eligible to vote in
   the upcoming election. Undergraduates are also ineligible to vote. **
   **
   The specific NLRB voter eligibility requirements can be found on [20]page
   two of the Election Notice.

   The op-ed authors also incorrectly assert that a union and collective
   bargaining agreement will address graduate student housing matters. MIT
   leaders have stated that they will continue to make improvements to
   graduate student housing through existing processes such as the
   [21]Graduate Housing Working Group but will not negotiate over housing as
   part of collective bargaining. They [22]wrote in part the following to
   graduate students: ***With the UE representing just a portion of our
   graduate students *** and because labor bargaining is primarily about the
   terms and conditions of employment *** the Institute would not negotiate
   with the UE on graduate student housing, curricular changes, and other
   subjects that are unrelated to students*** employment at MIT and also
   impact students outside the proposed bargaining unit. The UE and MIT GSU
   have made many of these issues central to their campaign, with promises on
   everything from affordable housing to expanded CPT opportunities for
   international students. But these issues are outside the bounds of what
   MIT believes that it could best address *** or would be legally required
   to address *** through collective bargaining with the UE.***
   **

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: Some MIT GSU students have [23]raised concerns that MIT is not
   doing enough to support international students, and asserting that a union
   can do more.

   FACT CHECK: When weighing these claims and considering how to vote in the
   April 4-5 election, international students should be aware of the
   following:

     o A collective bargaining agreement cannot legally make any changes to
       federal immigration law. MIT and its international students must
       follow federal immigration laws whether or not a union is elected.**
     o Federal immigration rules state that expanded internships and
       experiential learning opportunities that meet the requirements for F-1
       Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization must be done via
       changes to the curricula. Making changes to curricula is an academic
       decision that requires extensive input from various members of our
       community, including faculty, students, departmental administrators,
       and others. **
     o Academic decisions are not mandatory subjects of labor bargaining, and
       are usually retained by the university (as they are at Harvard and
       Columbia, for example). Notably, the graduate student union contracts
       at Harvard and Columbia do not contain provisions regarding expanded
       CPT opportunities. As an outcome of [24]Task Force 2021, MIT is
       already working on creating an Institute-wide professional development
       academic requirement for all graduate students. This would expand
       access to valuable internship, personal and interpersonal skills
       development, and experiential learning opportunities for all students.
       In doing so, it would also provide expanded CPT opportunities for all
       F-1 international students, addressing this problem across the board.

   Other facts to consider when evaluating MIT***s support for international
   students and determining where to stand on unionization include:

     o In 2020, together with Harvard University, MIT successfully filed suit
       against the US Department of Homeland Security and its Immigration and
       Customs Enforcement agency to prevent enforcement of a policy that
       would have barred international students on F-1 visas from taking a
       full online course load while studying in the United States.
     o Every year, [25]MIT***s International Students Office (ISO) assists
       more than 4,000 students and their families with their visas. Getting
       things wrong can have serious implications. That***s why MIT has a
       dedicated, growing group of professionals who provide important
       guidance to students. Neither the MIT GSU nor the UE have this level
       of expertise and resources.
     o In emergency or financial hardship situations,**MIT***s ISO covers
       legal fee costs for student consultations with immigration attorneys;
       pays USDHS application fees; and helps with emergency flights home and
       short-term family housing needs. International students are also
       eligible to seek and receive emergency funds from a number of other
       [26]MIT student support offices.**If the UE becomes the sole
       representative of graduate students in the bargaining unit, we do not
       know how these matters will be handled in contract negotiations and
       what an article on international students might look like.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: MIT forced international students abroad to return to the US in the
   middle of the pandemic.

   FACT CHECK: During the pandemic, MIT dedicated $5.8 million, and
   significant administrative resources, to enable 1,300 requests for remote
   international appointments. This ensured that students did not face any
   interruptions to their academic and research progress, and were able to
   continue their studies and research from abroad. In fact, MIT approved
   virtually every request (either as is, or with some modifications) for
   remote international appointments during the pandemic.

   MIT***s remote international appointments process is equally (if not more)
   accommodating than the processes contained in the Harvard and Columbia
   graduate student union contracts. Under those contracts, remote
   international work is limited to situations where students are
   ***unable*** to return to the U.S. due to immigration issues or other
   reasons outside of students*** control. When that occurs, Harvard and
   Columbia have agreed to make ***reasonable efforts*** to enable remote
   work. MIT went above and beyond ***reasonable efforts*** to enable remote
   work during the pandemic and to prevent negative impacts on students***
   studies, research, and personal lives.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: In a recent [27]Tech op-ed, MIT GSU students assert that ***MIT
   displaced hundreds of international students and their families from the
   Eastgate Apartments into Site 4, with skyrocketing rents.***

   FACT CHECK: When the more-than-50-year-old Eastgate residence hall, which
   was at the end of its useful life, closed and the new Site 4 building
   opened, MIT worked directly with the Eastgate community to provide
   financial support and moving assistance. Residents were also offered a
   variety of alternative housing options and support resources, including
   priority to relocate to other on-campus housing, support for residents
   seeking off-campus housing, and financial support to help bridge the price
   difference between Eastgate and Site 4.

   MIT***s financial support included a 15 percent discount on Site 4 rents
   as well as a need-based personalized transition subsidy for all students
   who moved from Eastgate to Site 4. Both the discount and the subsidy are
   being provided for the duration of students*** academic programs.

   CLAIM: MIT***s senior leaders are anti-union and engaging in
   union-busting.

   FACT CHECK: MIT***s leadership believes in and shares most of the goals of
   MIT students who support unionization. And these leaders understand and
   share some students*** frustration about how long change can sometimes
   take at a large, complex organization like MIT. They do not, however,
   believe a union will be able to produce better, quicker outcomes on the
   issues we mutually care about.**

   MIT***s senior leaders would like to continue to work with all 7,000
   students through the Institute***s time-tested collaborative model (one
   which together we have improved over time), rather than having the UE
   inserted as the sole representative for one segment of students and with a
   focus on only some issues (wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of
   employment). Ultimately, though, that will be a decision for the students
   in the bargaining unit to decide, not MIT***s senior leaders. But, just
   like students who are supportive of or opposed to unionization, MIT***s
   leaders are allowed to share their viewpoints and factual information
   about what a union could mean for students and the Institute.

   It***s also important to remember that MIT***s senior officers have been
   devoted to MIT for decades and care deeply about this Institution and the
   unique experience it offers to all students. That's why they***ve embraced
   roles in student support, academic life, and Institute administration
   rather than focusing solely on teaching and research. And that***s why, no
   matter the outcome of the election, they will continue to work in
   partnership with all students to make MIT better.

   CLAIM: The MIT GSU***s website states: ***RAs and TAs (including hourly
   appointments or fellowship appointments accompanied by a partial RA/TA
   appointment) will vote on April 4th and 5th. Following that, the Labor
   Board will rule on MIT***s argument that Fellows should be denied their
   right to vote for our union and set a date for a Fellows election.***

   FACT CHECK: On Monday, February 28, MIT and the UE reached a stipulated
   election agreement that does not include a follow-on ruling for fellows.
   There is no petition on file in which the UE is seeking to represent
   fellows.

   If the UE is planning to file a separate petition for fellows at a later
   date, they have not shared those plans with MIT and it is unclear whether
   such a petition would be filed this academic year or later. Critically,
   there is no guarantee that, if a petition is filed, that the NLRB will
   approve a second election for fellows.

   The MIT GSU recently added this to their website to clarify their
   intentions. ***After we win our union election with the RAs and TAs, we
   will file for an election with the students on fellowship. The NLRB will
   make the decision about MIT's issue around students on fellowships. We
   will then have an election for students on fellowship.*** This statement
   presumes the NLRB will rule in their favor which, as noted above, is far
   from certain.**

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: The UE is arguing that they did not exclude more than 2,000
   graduate students from their initial petition with the NLRB, and that
   MIT***s actions led an additional 900 fellows to be dropped from the
   proposed bargaining unit.

   FACT CHECK: MIT is highlighting the UE***s exclusion of 2,000 graduate
   students to make clear that applying federal labor rules to 7,000 graduate
   students fundamentally requires drawing lines within the graduate student
   body. Examples include: Who is a student vs. who is a student-employee?
   What is academic work vs. what is employment?

   Those 2,000+ students include hundreds of fully self-funded or fully
   externally-funded students in research-intensive masters and doctoral
   programs who are also in research groups and labs. The 2,000+ students
   also include several hundred students on tuition-only fellowships, as well
   as some students with hourly appointments.**
   **
   MIT***s senior leaders [28]believe that graduate students who are
   internally-supported through full MIT fellowship awards are more like
   externally-supported students than RAs and TAs. This distinction is made
   in several other graduate student collective bargaining agreements. MIT
   also had significant concerns that, if included in the bargaining unit,
   students on fellowship awards *** especially our international students
   *** would lose some of the important flexibility that comes with
   fellowships.
   **
   MIT and the UE were prepared to have the NLRB decide this issue. And, as
   students in support of unionization [29]acknowledged last week, MIT
   expressed a desire to have an election later this spring. But on Monday,
   February 28, the UE decided to remove the 900 internally-supported fellows
   from their proposed bargaining unit. That was their decision, not MIT***s.
   Indeed, MIT would have preferred clarity on this important issue from the
   NLRB. The UE removed the internal fellows so that they could proceed with
   an election earlier this spring for the other students in its proposed
   union.
   **
   Ultimately, MIT***s senior leaders do not want to draw any unnecessary
   lines among MIT***s 7,000 graduate students. However, the unionization
   process requires us to do that in one way or another.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: In addition to improving wages, hours, and other terms and
   conditions of employment, [30]the UE will force MIT to agree to a contract
   ***that reflects student priorities, codifies hard-fought wins, and
   ensures that we make progress towards a better MIT.***

   FACT CHECK: The truth is that MIT is only required by law to negotiate
   over compensation, hours of work, work duties, layoff and grievance
   procedures, and other terms and conditions of employment. The table below
   describes some of the mandatory and non-mandatory subjects of bargaining,
   as well as illegal subjects of bargaining.

   Work duties and      academic performance,

                        course and degree
                        requirements.**

                        Recognition clause defining the
                        bargaining unit

   * The NLRB generally does not consider employer housing to be a mandatory
   subject of bargaining if the employee is not forced to live in the
   provided housing. Graduate students may elect to utilize Institute housing
   because of their status as students, not because of their status as
   employees. They are not required to stay in MIT housing.

   ** Illegal subjects are those that cannot be legally bargained over by
   either party. They are subjects that would violate a law, and therefore
   cannot be entered into legally in a collective bargaining agreement, even
   if both parties agree to do so.

   *** [31]Federal laws and regulations limit the number of hours certain
   international students can work. Even if MIT and the UE both wanted to
   increase those hours, they would be unable to do so. Similarly, there are
   rules pertaining to international remote work that cannot be modified in a
   MIT-UE contract.

   The experience of graduate student unions at peer institutions can also
   illustrate the limitations of a union in securing particular contract
   provisions. For example, Harvard***s Graduate Student Union ratified its
   first contract after 20 months of negotiations and 26 months after the
   union***s certification. Its second contract was settled in November 2021,
   following a three-day strike, the threat of a second strike, and eight
   months of intense negotiations.**

   While the Harvard union did achieve some gains in compensation, health
   care coverage, and legal funding for Title IX and other misconduct
   processes, what was included in the final contract was considerably less
   than the union***s stated goals. For example, the union did not advance
   several key priorities, including changes to housing; processes for
   addressing allegations of sexual misconduct, discrimination, and academic
   retaliation; campus policing protocols; mental health care policies and
   procedures; designation of union officers as confidential Title IX/sexual
   misconduct resources; racial justice training for all faculty and staff;
   and staffing in Harvard***s student mental health office.**

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: A union will secure wins for graduate students much more quickly
   than MIT***s current committee processes.

   FACT CHECK: The Institute***s current annual processes for making
   adjustments and enhancements to [32]graduate student stipends and health
   insurance benefits typically take only a few months. Rates and benefits
   for the upcoming academic year are finalized, approved, and announced
   between March***May. Moreover, MIT***s close collaborative relationship
   with its graduate students often enables the Institute to move faster in
   addressing emerging needs than would be possible in negotiating a new
   contract with a union.

   Negotiating a collective bargaining agreement *** and specifically, the
   first agreement between MIT and the UE *** will likely take much longer
   than our current process, meaning students may not know their final
   compensation or benefits for the coming academic year until a contract is
   finalized and ratified through a vote of union members. Some current
   graduate students may graduate before an initial contract is reached and
   ratified.**

   It is unclear whether students*** compensation and benefits would remain
   at their current levels during the negotiation period, no matter how long
   negotiations take.

   Between 475 and 1,504 days elapse before a first contract is reached
   between student unions and private universities, and strikes are very
   possible during negotiations.

   The table below provides examples of the length of student union contract
   negotiations at other institutions of higher education based on available
   information, and also notes when student-authorized strikes have taken
   place:

   * Negotiations began in October 2018 and ended in June 2020, and included
   a 29-day strike in December 2019. The parties initially agreed only to a
   one-year contract, which expired on June 30, 2021. The parties agreed to a
   second contract, which was ratified in November 2021, with 70.6 percent of
   voters in support of the new deal, and after a three-day strike and the
   threat of a second strike.

   ** The NLRB election was held in December 2016; the NLRB issued its
   decision certifying the union on December 16, 2017. Negotiations for a
   first contract started in February 2019 and a tentative agreement was
   reached in April 2021 but was voted down by union members. In July 2021,
   union members elected a new union bargaining committee after all 10
   members of the union***s bargaining committee stepped down. The parties
   reached a second tentative agreement on January 6, 2022, and the
   membership ratified the agreement on January 28, 2022. More than 5 years
   elapsed from the date of the union election to the date of the
   ratification of the first contract.**

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: As a democratic union, all graduate students will decide together
   what to include in a contract.

   FACT CHECK: If the UE prevails in an election, it would represent a large
   body, so it is highly unlikely that every student member will have a say
   during collective bargaining.

   We don***t know exactly how the UE will conduct its business, but in many
   negotiation settings, decisions about what to do at the bargaining table,
   including what proposals to make or drop, what employer proposals to
   accept, and what to counter-propose, will likely be made by the bargaining
   team, perhaps with an advisory body of members consulting. The bargaining
   team at Harvard, for example, has consisted of about a dozen students
   representing a unit of some 4,500 students.**

   The final tentative agreement that may be reached will likely be voted on
   by the entire union membership, but that means only those individuals in
   the bargaining unit who have decided to actually join the union and pay
   dues.**At Harvard, for example, we understand that union members currently
   constitute about 33 percent of the entire bargaining unit.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: The UE will make things better for all MIT graduate students, and
   stipends will never decrease with a union.

   FACT CHECK: The law requires parties to negotiate in good faith on
   mandatory subjects of bargaining, but neither side is required to make a
   particular concession, or agree to a particular proposal. No one can
   guarantee what a final collective bargaining agreement will contain.
   Bargaining does not necessarily begin with the status quo, and MIT, like
   the union, would have the authority to propose changes to the status quo.
   The outcome of such negotiations simply cannot be known in advance.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: A contract will not prevent a student from working more than the
   work-hour limits agreed to by the UE and MIT.

   FACT CHECK: We do not know what a workload article in a future collective
   bargaining agreement will look like, or what restrictions may be placed on
   work hours and assignments.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

                                   Background

   The following page provides high-level information and definitions about
   various aspects of unionization. For additional details, please refer to
   the [10]FAQ.

Bargaining unit

   The bargaining unit certified by the NLRB is:

   Graduate students enrolled in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
   degree programs who are employed to provide instructional or research
   services, including research assistants, teaching assistants, and
   instructor G's, but excluding undergraduate students; graduate student
   resident advisors; graduate fellows who are not also employed as either
   research assistants or teaching assistants; hourly graders who are not
   also employed as either research assistants or teaching assistants;
   graduate students not seeking MIT degrees, including visiting students;
   office clericals, managers, guards, and supervisors as defined in the Act.

   However, certain research assistants in the Linguistics and Political
   Science departments; hourly employees who are not graders and who may
   provide instructional or research services; and graduate students
   conducting research at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) who
   are either supervised or paid by MIT (but not both), are neither included
   in or excluded from the bargaining unit covered by this certification,
   inasmuch as the parties did not agree on the inclusion or exclusion of
   these classifications but agreed to vote them subject to challenge and
   resolution of their inclusion or exclusion was unnecessary because their
   ballots were not determinative of the election results.

Bargaining subjects

   MIT is required by law to negotiate over compensation, hours of work, work
   duties, layoff and grievance procedures, and other terms and conditions of
   employment for bargaining unit members. The table below describes some of
   the mandatory and non-mandatory subjects of bargaining, as well as illegal
   subjects of bargaining. MIT cannot negotiate with the MIT GSU-UE over
   illegal subjects of bargaining but can decide whether or not to take up
   non-mandatory subjects of bargaining during negotiations or through other
   Institute processes such as Institute committees and working groups.

   * The NLRB generally does not consider employer housing to be a mandatory
   subject of bargaining if the employee is not forced to live in the
   provided housing. Graduate students may elect to utilize Institute housing
   because of their status as students, not because of their status as
   employees. They are not required to stay in MIT housing.

   ** Illegal subjects are those that cannot be legally bargained over by
   either party. They are subjects that would violate a law, and therefore
   cannot be entered into legally in a collective bargaining agreement, even
   if both parties agree to do so.

   *** [11]Federal laws and regulations limit the number of hours certain
   international students can work. Even if MIT and the MIT GSU-UE both
   wanted to increase those hours, they would be unable to do so. Similarly,
   there are rules pertaining to international remote work that cannot be
   modified in a MIT**GSU-UE contract.

    2. Fact-checking claims about unionization

                    Fact-checking claims about unionization

   The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) can promise
   whatever it wants during a unionization campaign, but it cannot guarantee
   that it will be able to back up these promises. It is essential that,
   before voting, all graduate students become fully informed about the
   issues at stake, so that each student can make their own determination
   about what***s in their best interest.

   Becoming fully informed requires that each student assess the validity of
   assertions being made about unionization, and to weigh the potential
   benefits and costs of unionization. What follows is a fact check of some
   common claims.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 28, 2022

   CLAIM: A recent [15]post by the MIT GSU states: MIT Medical***s decision
   to close the MIT Pharmacy ***decreases the ability for rapid treatment and
   leaves students with only external vendors for filling prescriptions ***
   which have higher co-pays with our insurance plan.*** The post also claims
   that the ***MIT admin has a long history of ignoring our healthcare needs,
   as well as lowering our existing healthcare access and coverage: denying
   full dental coverage, retracting health insurance coverage terms.***
   **
   FACT CHECK: Same-day prescription deliveries are available to MIT
   community members via [16]Capsule *** a pharmacy service that delivers
   directly to homes and campus residences within hours of orders being
   placed. Further, if you have filled a prescription at the MIT Pharmacy
   after March 1, 2021, and you fill a new prescription at any in-network
   pharmacy after March 25, 2022, you will be refunded any difference in
   price through the end of the insurance plan year, December 31, 2022.
   **
   More broadly, as outlined in [17]this op-ed that appeared in The Tech on
   November 3, 2021, MIT offers graduate students competitive and reasonably
   priced health and dental insurance, provides generous support for students
   facing medical and other financial hardships, and works collaboratively
   with students to improve our delivery of medical services. Additionally,
   [18]emergency medical funding for graduate students is available.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 17, 2022

   CLAIM: In a recent Tech [19]op-ed authored by GSU members *** ***Without a
   union, MIT is failing GRAs and undergraduates alike*** *** the authors
   state: ***With a union, GRAs and all other graduate students will have the
   collective power we need to resolve our [housing] issues.*** This implies
   that all GRAs (and potentially undergraduates) are in the proposed
   bargaining unit and are eligible to vote. It also implies that MIT will
   negotiate with the UE (instead of working through our current processes)
   over matters related to graduate student housing if the union is elected.
   **
   FACT CHECK: Graduate students who have only a GRA appointment are not part
   of the UE***s proposed unit. Only those GRAs with a separate RA, TA, or
   Instructor G appointment (i.e., those employed to provide instructional or
   research services), as per the NLRB***s voter eligibility requirements
   (below), are part of the proposed bargaining unit and eligible to vote in
   the upcoming election. Undergraduates are also ineligible to vote. **
   **
   The specific NLRB voter eligibility requirements can be found on [20]page
   two of the Election Notice.

   The op-ed authors also incorrectly assert that a union and collective
   bargaining agreement will address graduate student housing matters. MIT
   leaders have stated that they will continue to make improvements to
   graduate student housing through existing processes such as the
   [21]Graduate Housing Working Group but will not negotiate over housing as
   part of collective bargaining. They [22]wrote in part the following to
   graduate students: ***With the UE representing just a portion of our
   graduate students *** and because labor bargaining is primarily about the
   terms and conditions of employment *** the Institute would not negotiate
   with the UE on graduate student housing, curricular changes, and other
   subjects that are unrelated to students*** employment at MIT and also
   impact students outside the proposed bargaining unit. The UE and MIT GSU
   have made many of these issues central to their campaign, with promises on
   everything from affordable housing to expanded CPT opportunities for
   international students. But these issues are outside the bounds of what
   MIT believes that it could best address *** or would be legally required
   to address *** through collective bargaining with the UE.***
   **

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: Some MIT GSU students have [23]raised concerns that MIT is not
   doing enough to support international students, and asserting that a union
   can do more.

   FACT CHECK: When weighing these claims and considering how to vote in the
   April 4-5 election, international students should be aware of the
   following:

     o A collective bargaining agreement cannot legally make any changes to
       federal immigration law. MIT and its international students must
       follow federal immigration laws whether or not a union is elected.**
     o Federal immigration rules state that expanded internships and
       experiential learning opportunities that meet the requirements for F-1
       Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization must be done via
       changes to the curricula. Making changes to curricula is an academic
       decision that requires extensive input from various members of our
       community, including faculty, students, departmental administrators,
       and others. **
     o Academic decisions are not mandatory subjects of labor bargaining, and
       are usually retained by the university (as they are at Harvard and
       Columbia, for example). Notably, the graduate student union contracts
       at Harvard and Columbia do not contain provisions regarding expanded
       CPT opportunities. As an outcome of [24]Task Force 2021, MIT is
       already working on creating an Institute-wide professional development
       academic requirement for all graduate students. This would expand
       access to valuable internship, personal and interpersonal skills
       development, and experiential learning opportunities for all students.
       In doing so, it would also provide expanded CPT opportunities for all
       F-1 international students, addressing this problem across the board.

   Other facts to consider when evaluating MIT***s support for international
   students and determining where to stand on unionization include:

     o In 2020, together with Harvard University, MIT successfully filed suit
       against the US Department of Homeland Security and its Immigration and
       Customs Enforcement agency to prevent enforcement of a policy that
       would have barred international students on F-1 visas from taking a
       full online course load while studying in the United States.
     o Every year, [25]MIT***s International Students Office (ISO) assists
       more than 4,000 students and their families with their visas. Getting
       things wrong can have serious implications. That***s why MIT has a
       dedicated, growing group of professionals who provide important
       guidance to students. Neither the MIT GSU nor the UE have this level
       of expertise and resources.
     o In emergency or financial hardship situations,**MIT***s ISO covers
       legal fee costs for student consultations with immigration attorneys;
       pays USDHS application fees; and helps with emergency flights home and
       short-term family housing needs. International students are also
       eligible to seek and receive emergency funds from a number of other
       [26]MIT student support offices.**If the UE becomes the sole
       representative of graduate students in the bargaining unit, we do not
       know how these matters will be handled in contract negotiations and
       what an article on international students might look like.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: MIT forced international students abroad to return to the US in the
   middle of the pandemic.

   FACT CHECK: During the pandemic, MIT dedicated $5.8 million, and
   significant administrative resources, to enable 1,300 requests for remote
   international appointments. This ensured that students did not face any
   interruptions to their academic and research progress, and were able to
   continue their studies and research from abroad. In fact, MIT approved
   virtually every request (either as is, or with some modifications) for
   remote international appointments during the pandemic.

   MIT***s remote international appointments process is equally (if not more)
   accommodating than the processes contained in the Harvard and Columbia
   graduate student union contracts. Under those contracts, remote
   international work is limited to situations where students are
   ***unable*** to return to the U.S. due to immigration issues or other
   reasons outside of students*** control. When that occurs, Harvard and
   Columbia have agreed to make ***reasonable efforts*** to enable remote
   work. MIT went above and beyond ***reasonable efforts*** to enable remote
   work during the pandemic and to prevent negative impacts on students***
   studies, research, and personal lives.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: In a recent [27]Tech op-ed, MIT GSU students assert that ***MIT
   displaced hundreds of international students and their families from the
   Eastgate Apartments into Site 4, with skyrocketing rents.***

   FACT CHECK: When the more-than-50-year-old Eastgate residence hall, which
   was at the end of its useful life, closed and the new Site 4 building
   opened, MIT worked directly with the Eastgate community to provide
   financial support and moving assistance. Residents were also offered a
   variety of alternative housing options and support resources, including
   priority to relocate to other on-campus housing, support for residents
   seeking off-campus housing, and financial support to help bridge the price
   difference between Eastgate and Site 4.

   MIT***s financial support included a 15 percent discount on Site 4 rents
   as well as a need-based personalized transition subsidy for all students
   who moved from Eastgate to Site 4. Both the discount and the subsidy are
   being provided for the duration of students*** academic programs.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: MIT***s senior leaders are anti-union and engaging in
   union-busting.

   FACT CHECK: MIT***s leadership believes in and shares most of the goals of
   MIT students who support unionization. And these leaders understand and
   share some students*** frustration about how long change can sometimes
   take at a large, complex organization like MIT. They do not, however,
   believe a union will be able to produce better, quicker outcomes on the
   issues we mutually care about.**

   MIT***s senior leaders would like to continue to work with all 7,000
   students through the Institute***s time-tested collaborative model (one
   which together we have improved over time), rather than having the UE
   inserted as the sole representative for one segment of students and with a
   focus on only some issues (wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of
   employment). Ultimately, though, that will be a decision for the students
   in the bargaining unit to decide, not MIT***s senior leaders. But, just
   like students who are supportive of or opposed to unionization, MIT***s
   leaders are allowed to share their viewpoints and factual information
   about what a union could mean for students and the Institute.

   It***s also important to remember that MIT***s senior officers have been
   devoted to MIT for decades and care deeply about this Institution and the
   unique experience it offers to all students. That's why they***ve embraced
   roles in student support, academic life, and Institute administration
   rather than focusing solely on teaching and research. And that***s why, no
   matter the outcome of the election, they will continue to work in
   partnership with all students to make MIT better.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: The MIT GSU***s website states: ***RAs and TAs (including hourly
   appointments or fellowship appointments accompanied by a partial RA/TA
   appointment) will vote on April 4th and 5th. Following that, the Labor
   Board will rule on MIT***s argument that Fellows should be denied their
   right to vote for our union and set a date for a Fellows election.***

   FACT CHECK: On Monday, February 28, MIT and the UE reached a stipulated
   election agreement that does not include a follow-on ruling for fellows.
   There is no petition on file in which the UE is seeking to represent
   fellows.

   If the UE is planning to file a separate petition for fellows at a later
   date, they have not shared those plans with MIT and it is unclear whether
   such a petition would be filed this academic year or later. Critically,
   there is no guarantee that, if a petition is filed, that the NLRB will
   approve a second election for fellows.

   The MIT GSU recently added this to their website to clarify their
   intentions. ***After we win our union election with the RAs and TAs, we
   will file for an election with the students on fellowship. The NLRB will
   make the decision about MIT's issue around students on fellowships. We
   will then have an election for students on fellowship.*** This statement
   presumes the NLRB will rule in their favor which, as noted above, is far
   from certain.**

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Added March 4, 2022

   CLAIM: The UE is arguing that they did not exclude more than 2,000
   graduate students from their initial petition with the NLRB, and that
   MIT***s actions led an additional 900 fellows to be dropped from the
   proposed bargaining unit.

   FACT CHECK: MIT is highlighting the UE***s exclusion of 2,000 graduate
   students to make clear that applying federal labor rules to 7,000 graduate
   students fundamentally requires drawing lines within the graduate student
   body. Examples include: Who is a student vs. who is a student-employee?
   What is academic work vs. what is employment?

   Those 2,000+ students include hundreds of fully self-funded or fully
   externally-funded students in research-intensive masters and doctoral
   programs who are also in research groups and labs. The 2,000+ students
   also include several hundred students on tuition-only fellowships, as well
   as some students with hourly appointments.**
   **
   MIT***s senior leaders [28]believe that graduate students who are
   internally-supported through full MIT fellowship awards are more like
   externally-supported students than RAs and TAs. This distinction is made
   in several other graduate student collective bargaining agreements. MIT
   also had significant concerns that, if included in the bargaining unit,
   students on fellowship awards *** especially our international students
   *** would lose some of the important flexibility that comes with
   fellowships.
   **
   MIT and the UE were prepared to have the NLRB decide this issue. And, as
   students in support of unionization [29]acknowledged last week, MIT
   expressed a desire to have an election later this spring. But on Monday,
   February 28, the UE decided to remove the 900 internally-supported fellows
   from their proposed bargaining unit. That was their decision, not MIT***s.
   Indeed, MIT would have preferred clarity on this important issue from the
   NLRB. The UE removed the internal fellows so that they could proceed with
   an election earlier this spring for the other students in its proposed
   union.
   **
   Ultimately, MIT***s senior leaders do not want to draw any unnecessary
   lines among MIT***s 7,000 graduate students. However, the unionization
   process requires us to do that in one way or another.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: In addition to improving wages, hours, and other terms and
   conditions of employment, [30]the UE will force MIT to agree to a contract
   ***that reflects student priorities, codifies hard-fought wins, and
   ensures that we make progress towards a better MIT.***

   FACT CHECK: The truth is that MIT is only required by law to negotiate
   over compensation, hours of work, work duties, layoff and grievance
   procedures, and other terms and conditions of employment. The table below
   describes some of the mandatory and non-mandatory subjects of bargaining,
   as well as illegal subjects of bargaining.

   * The NLRB generally does not consider employer housing to be a mandatory
   subject of bargaining if the employee is not forced to live in the
   provided housing. Graduate students may elect to utilize Institute housing
   because of their status as students, not because of their status as
   employees. They are not required to stay in MIT housing.

   ** Illegal subjects are those that cannot be legally bargained over by
   either party. They are subjects that would violate a law, and therefore
   cannot be entered into legally in a collective bargaining agreement, even
   if both parties agree to do so.

   *** [31]Federal laws and regulations limit the number of hours certain
   international students can work. Even if MIT and the UE both wanted to
   increase those hours, they would be unable to do so. Similarly, there are
   rules pertaining to international remote work that cannot be modified in a
   MIT-UE contract.

   The experience of graduate student unions at peer institutions can also
   illustrate the limitations of a union in securing particular contract
   provisions. For example, Harvard***s Graduate Student Union ratified its
   first contract after 20 months of negotiations and 26 months after the
   union***s certification. Its second contract was settled in November 2021,
   following a three-day strike, the threat of a second strike, and eight
   months of intense negotiations.**

   While the Harvard union did achieve some gains in compensation, health
   care coverage, and legal funding for Title IX and other misconduct
   processes, what was included in the final contract was considerably less
   than the union***s stated goals. For example, the union did not advance
   several key priorities, including changes to housing; processes for
   addressing allegations of sexual misconduct, discrimination, and academic
   retaliation; campus policing protocols; mental health care policies and
   procedures; designation of union officers as confidential Title IX/sexual
   misconduct resources; racial justice training for all faculty and staff;
   and staffing in Harvard***s student mental health office.**

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: A union will secure wins for graduate students much more quickly
   than MIT***s current committee processes.

   FACT CHECK: The Institute***s current annual processes for making
   adjustments and enhancements to [32]graduate student stipends and health
   insurance benefits typically take only a few months. Rates and benefits
   for the upcoming academic year are finalized, approved, and announced
   between March***May. Moreover, MIT***s close collaborative relationship
   with its graduate students often enables the Institute to move faster in
   addressing emerging needs than would be possible in negotiating a new
   contract with a union.

   Negotiating a collective bargaining agreement *** and specifically, the
   first agreement between MIT and the UE *** will likely take much longer
   than our current process, meaning students may not know their final
   compensation or benefits for the coming academic year until a contract is
   finalized and ratified through a vote of union members. Some current
   graduate students may graduate before an initial contract is reached and
   ratified.**

   It is unclear whether students*** compensation and benefits would remain
   at their current levels during the negotiation period, no matter how long
   negotiations take.

   Between 475 and 1,504 days elapse before a first contract is reached
   between student unions and private universities, and strikes are very
   possible during negotiations.

   The table below provides examples of the length of student union contract
   negotiations at other institutions of higher education based on available
   information, and also notes when student-authorized strikes have taken
   place:

   * Negotiations began in October 2018 and ended in June 2020, and included
   a 29-day strike in December 2019. The parties initially agreed only to a
   one-year contract, which expired on June 30, 2021. The parties agreed to a
   second contract, which was ratified in November 2021, with 70.6 percent of
   voters in support of the new deal, and after a three-day strike and the
   threat of a second strike.

   ** The NLRB election was held in December 2016; the NLRB issued its
   decision certifying the union on December 16, 2017. Negotiations for a
   first contract started in February 2019 and a tentative agreement was
   reached in April 2021 but was voted down by union members. In July 2021,
   union members elected a new union bargaining committee after all 10
   members of the union***s bargaining committee stepped down. The parties
   reached a second tentative agreement on January 6, 2022, and the
   membership ratified the agreement on January 28, 2022. More than 5 years
   elapsed from the date of the union election to the date of the
   ratification of the first contract.**

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: As a democratic union, all graduate students will decide together
   what to include in a contract.

   FACT CHECK: If the UE prevails in an election, it would represent a large
   body, so it is highly unlikely that every student member will have a say
   during collective bargaining.

   We don***t know exactly how the UE will conduct its business, but in many
   negotiation settings, decisions about what to do at the bargaining table,
   including what proposals to make or drop, what employer proposals to
   accept, and what to counter-propose, will likely be made by the bargaining
   team, perhaps with an advisory body of members consulting. The bargaining
   team at Harvard, for example, has consisted of about a dozen students
   representing a unit of some 4,500 students.**

   The final tentative agreement that may be reached will likely be voted on
   by the entire union membership, but that means only those individuals in
   the bargaining unit who have decided to actually join the union and pay
   dues.**At Harvard, for example, we understand that union members currently
   constitute about 33 percent of the entire bargaining unit.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: The UE will make things better for all MIT graduate students, and
   stipends will never decrease with a union.

   FACT CHECK: The law requires parties to negotiate in good faith on
   mandatory subjects of bargaining, but neither side is required to make a
   particular concession, or agree to a particular proposal. No one can
   guarantee what a final collective bargaining agreement will contain.
   Bargaining does not necessarily begin with the status quo, and MIT, like
   the union, would have the authority to propose changes to the status quo.
   The outcome of such negotiations simply cannot be known in advance.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   CLAIM: A contract will not prevent a student from working more than the
   work-hour limits agreed to by the UE and MIT.

   FACT CHECK: We do not know what a workload article in a future collective
   bargaining agreement will look like, or what restrictions may be placed on
   work hours and assignments.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.**

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the story.
   MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions, discuss
   issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate information.

   [9]MIT Campus

   On April 6, 2022, Chancellor Melissa Nobles and Vice Chancellor Ian Waitz
   [10]announced the results of the April 4-5 graduate student unionization
   election; congratulated current and past MIT GSU-UE members on their four
   years of dedicated work that culminated in the union***s election; and
   committed to bargain in good faith with the union over the terms and
   conditions of employment for bargaining unit members.

   Those initial negotiations will get underway in September 2022 and are
   likely to take at least several months to complete. At other universities
   with graduate student unions, negotiating a first contract has taken at
   least one year (from the date of certification to ratification) and, in
   several cases, multiple years.

   This website serves as a central resource with information about:

     o Which [11]graduate students are represented by the MIT GSU-UE.
     o The collective bargaining process and topics that are considered
       [12]mandatory subjects of bargaining and therefore must be discussed
       at the bargaining table.
     o Topics that are [13]non-mandatory subjects of bargaining, which means
       that employers can decide whether to bargain over them or to work
       through existing channels such as Institute committees or working
       groups.
     o The [14]latest updates, including letters and other announcements for
       the MIT community as well as, when finalized, the contract between MIT
       and the MIT GSU-UE.

   Community members with questions about unions and unionization that are
   not addressed on this website may contact**[15]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.

    2. How the current student-administration collaboration and successes
       compare to institutions with graduate student unions

 How the current student-administration collaboration and successes compare to
                   institutions with graduate student unions

   MIT is proud of the accomplishments we have achieved in direct and
   collaborative partnership with graduate student leaders.

   It is worth noting that MIT***s approach to governance is unique, as
   almost all standing faculty committees include student participation. In
   the words of a past chair of the faculty, ***Students not only bring their
   fresh eyes and perspectives to bear on agenda items, but their presence
   signals the inclusive nature of our governance system *** with all its
   shared responsibilities.*****

   A strong example of student-administration collaboration rests with the
   Graduate Student Council (GSC). GSC representatives typically meet several
   times a month with MIT administrative leaders, and as needed (often
   weekly) to address more urgent issues *** such as Covid-19, evolving
   policies that may impact international students, and campus culture. This
   ongoing partnership allows the Institute to work quickly to address
   emerging needs *** a degree of responsiveness that would be difficult to
   match if the relationship between MIT and its graduate students were
   governed by a long-term contract.

   Further, the GSC plays an essential role in the yearly process of setting
   graduate student stipends and benefits, providing a cost-of-living
   analysis that is instrumental in determining levels. The GSC also has been
   active in improving and shaping the graduate student residential
   experience through the [15]Graduate Housing Working Group, which has five
   student members.

   In short, our graduate students have had a voice and a seat at the table,
   and would continue to have such a role without a union.

As a result of this strong working relationship, here is what we have achieved
together:

   On graduate student stipends, MIT already compares favorably to the nine
   private American universities that have graduate student unions: American
   University, Brandeis University, Brown University, Columbia University,
   Georgetown University, Harvard University, The New School, New York
   University, and Tufts University.

   MIT, with a higher minimum stipend for graduate students than all nine of
   these unionized institutions (using AY23 12 month PhD RA stipend),
   voluntarily granted graduate students a 3 percent mid-year stipend
   increase in the current academic year. **Last summer, the Institute
   increased its stipend ranges for 2021-22 by 3.25 percent, exceeding the
   GSC***s Stipend Working Group estimate of the change in cost-of-living by
   more than 1 percent. This increase was the product of MIT***s longstanding
   student-led annual stipend process, which allows stipends to be set every
   year based on economic circumstances. The Institute then included graduate
   students in the special 3 percent pay increase given to most employees
   last fall, following the MIT endowment***s recent strong performance.
   Then, on March 30, MIT announced a further 5.5 percent stipend increase
   for the coming academic year (AY23), effective June 1. As a result,
   stipend levels for AY23 will be approximately 8.67 percent higher than
   they were at the start of AY22.
   **
   This 8.67 percent increase is more than the year-over-year increases that
   students will receive at any of the private universities that have a
   graduate student union. Even at Harvard and Columbia *** each of which
   experienced strikes in recent months, during the negotiation of their new
   agreements *** stipends will increase only by 4 percent and 3 percent,
   respectively, between AY22 and AY23. Most of the other unionized
   universities will increase their graduate student stipends by just 2 to 3
   percent next year.

   MIT provides its graduate students with [16]comprehensive health insurance
   whose premiums compare very favorably to those at our peer institutions.
   Rates for individual students, or for students and their partners, are
   [17]on par with or less expensive than those at peers such as Brown, Yale,
   Harvard, Dartmouth, and Stanford. Further, MIT***s rates for plans
   including spouses and children are significantly lower than those peers
   *** often by half *** and family plans are nearly two-thirds less
   expensive. Students also have multiple other insurance options available
   to them. For graduate students who encounter financial hardship ***
   whether due to medical or other expenses *** MIT offers many types of
   [18]emergency financial assistance. Finally, MIT Medical is always
   available to hear students*** concerns directly, and student leaders and
   student groups are actively engaged in assessing and improving student
   coverage options.

   MIT***s Office of Graduate Education has also [19]enhanced available
   financial assistance and grants, including by increasing its commitment to
   the need-blind Grants for Graduate Students with Children program, raising
   award levels from $2,000-$4,000 to $5,000-$7,000. See more information
   about MIT***s various types of [20]financial support for graduate
   students.

   MIT***s other collaborative work with graduate students has led to
   commitments that address concerns about [21]our campus climate and
   culture. These commitments include, for example, additional resources and
   hiring within the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office,
   as well as the first phase of [22]guaranteed transitional funding for
   graduate students who change research groups or advisors, including cases
   where the student leaves because of allegations of harassment and
   discrimination. MIT also continues to work to address many of the issues
   being raised by graduate students in support of [23]action on diversity,
   equity, and inclusion. We are committed to continuing our direct and
   collaborative work with all of our graduate students on these and other
   important issues.

   Finally, MIT has championed its international students: To help manage the
   challenges that the pandemic and other recent events have presented for
   its international graduate students, MIT allocated $5.8 million, and
   significant administrative resources, to facilitate roughly 1,300 remote
   appointments. In 2020, together with Harvard University, MIT successfully
   [24]filed suit against ICE and the US Department of Homeland Security to
   prevent enforcement of a policy that would have barred international
   students on F-1 visas from taking a full online course load while studying
   in the United States.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

    2. Recent gains for MIT graduate students

                     Recent gains for MIT graduate students

   MIT recognizes that its 7,000 graduate students are one of the most
   talented scholarly cohorts in the world. The Institute strongly encourages
   all graduate students to learn more about the gains and successes that
   have resulted from its collaborative approach to student-Institute
   processes and partnerships.

   Many of MIT***s collaborative efforts with student leaders over the past
   few years have been focused on helping graduate students who have faced
   acute financial and personal challenges. This approach has been advocated
   by the Institute***s student community, is in keeping with MIT***s spirit
   and values, and informs MIT***s work to create a more caring and
   supportive environment for everyone.

   Graduate Student Council (GSC) representatives typically meet several
   times a month with MIT administrative leaders, and as needed to address
   more urgent issues *** such as Covid-19, evolving policies that may impact
   international students, and campus culture. Further, the GSC plays an
   essential role in the yearly process of setting graduate student stipends
   and benefits, and has been active in improving and shaping the graduate
   student residential experience through the**[15]Graduate Housing Working
   Group,**which has five student members. This ongoing partnership allows
   the Institute to work quickly to address emerging needs *** a degree of
   responsiveness that would be difficult to match if the relationship
   between MIT and its graduate students were governed by a long-term
   contract.

   Over the past five years, the MIT-student collaboration has led to
   numerous accomplishments, including:

     o Greater financial security for all students: MIT***s
       cost-of-living-based stipend increases have outpaced those of our
       peers, and those of private universities with graduate student unions.
       With the proceeds from its recent strong endowment returns, MIT has
       invested in all members of the community, including graduate students.
     o In response to student requests, MIT has invested in students with the
       most pressing needs: The Institute has established new programs and
       staffing, and has allocated approximately $1 million in grants for
       graduate students with families, students on short-term appointments,
       and doctoral students needing longer-term support.
     o MIT has provided enhanced health and wellness support: It has added
       more support professionals and virtual visits. MIT Medical continues
       to offer excellent, low-cost, robust [16]health insurance options, and
       has expanded access to behavioral health care.
     o MIT has championed its international students: To help manage the
       challenges that the pandemic and other recent events have presented
       for its international graduate students, MIT allocated $5.8 million,
       and significant administrative resources, to facilitate roughly 1,300
       remote appointments. In 2020, together with Harvard University, MIT
       successfully [17]filed suit against ICE and the US Department of
       Homeland Security to prevent enforcement of a policy that would have
       barred international students on F-1 visas from taking a full online
       course load while studying in the United States.
     o MIT has worked to build a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse
       community: It has hired school-based diversity deans, and fought for
       and won enhanced protections for international students.**
     o MIT has expanded the support networks for graduate students**and is
       combatting harassment in academia: It has invested [18]additional
       resources in its Violence Prevention and Response and Institute
       Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR) offices; refined
       [19]anti-retaliation policies; provided [20]guaranteed transitional
       funding for students who switch labs or advisors;**and offered
       additional [21]mentoring and harassment prevention training.
       Additionally, IDHR is now a central hub for [22]reporting
       discriminatory treatment and [23]publishes an annual report detailing
       the nature of discrimination, bias, and harassment cases handled by
       IDHR involving students, faculty, and staff.
     o MIT has responded effectively to the challenges of the pandemic. The
       Institute kept our community safe, while allowing mission-critical
       teaching and research to continue. Throughout the pandemic, MIT
       offered its students generous assistance with housing costs, moving
       expenses, and other financial burdens associated with Covid-19.
     o MIT has fostered the personal and professional growth of its students:
       It has enhanced advising and training, offered more than 40 workshops
       and panels through partnerships with 15 academic and administrative
       departments, and developed more focused career fairs and networking
       opportunities. New staff have been added within Career Advising and
       Professional Development and the Office of Graduate Education to
       support graduate students.

   The Institute is proud of what its graduate students, faculty, and staff
   have accomplished together in recent years to enhance the graduate student
   experience. The following ongoing efforts will build on the above gains
   that have already been made together:

     o MIT***s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Strategic Action Plan,
       which is on track to be released and implemented beginning in spring
       2022;
     o recommendations for improvements focused on campus safety and
       policing, phase two of the guaranteed transitional support program,
       and advising and mentoring, which are all scheduled to be issued and
       considered by the MIT administration in the spring semester; and
     o existing work to increase financial support for MIT***s 7,000 graduate
       students, improve student life by continuing to modernize campus
       facilities, and strengthen classroom and digital learning experiences.

   Additional information is available on the [24]Office of the Vice
   Chancellor website.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.

                             December 2022 updates

Negotiations

     o Nine bargaining sessions have been held this semester, most of which
       were full-day sessions. MIT and the MIT GSU-UE have been working their
       way through over 100 [10]non-economic provisions brought forth by the
       union.
     o These provisions are organized into 22 contract articles that MIT and
       the MIT GSU-UE have been exchanging. We have reached a tentative
       agreement on several articles and are close to an agreement on many
       others.**
     o The union***s proposals, which would apply to bargaining unit members
       across all of MIT***s 109 graduate programs, are thoughtful and
       comprehensive. We have spent the most time discussing concerns raised
       by the union on our health and safety processes, resources for
       international students, and our processes for responding to sexual
       misconduct and harassment. MIT administrators and faculty who have
       expertise on these topics have attended bargaining sessions to listen
       to and consider the union***s proposals. We also have been exploring
       peer practices on these issues and providing data and information to
       union negotiators so we are working from a common set of facts.
     o In the coming weeks, the union will present its economic proposals,
       which will include items such as stipends and benefits. Once we
       receive these proposals, we will work diligently with the union; with
       departments, labs, and programs; and with other stakeholders to reach
       an agreement.

Systems

     o Multiple MIT information systems and appointments processes will need
       to be updated to better track appointment information and to ensure
       compliance with the final contract between MIT and the MIT GSU-UE.**
     o All graduate students, as well as administrators who use these
       systems, can expect to see changes and/or enhancements in the coming
       weeks and months.**

Petition to add fellows

     o The [11]MIT GSU-UE filed a petition in September seeking to add
       students on fellowships to the existing bargaining unit. The NLRB held
       a hearing in late October on the issue.
     o During the hearing, the MIT GSU-UE argued that all fellows are
       employees because they conduct thesis research, which advances MIT***s
       mission of creating ***new knowledge,*** and they receive pay from
       MIT.
     o [12]MIT and [13]the union filed post-hearing briefs on November 10.
       Among other issues, MIT raised serious concerns about the union***s
       argument that all thesis research constitutes employment services, and
       the negative consequences that such equivalency would have, in
       particular, on international students. The NLRB will decide this
       issue, a process that may take several months. We encourage you to
       read [14]this summary to learn more.

MIT***s position statement on why fellows shouldn***t be included in the UE***s
                            proposed bargaining unit

   MIT***s senior leadership does not believe that unionization is the most
   constructive path forward for our graduate students, and have shared their
   concerns in [8]recent letters to the graduate student body.

   The following statement explains why they do not think students with full
   MIT fellowship awards should be part of the bargaining unit proposed by
   the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE). It also addresses
   several inaccuracies and omitted facts in the recent [9]Tech op-ed titled
   ***MIT***s administration seeks to exclude over 1,000 graduate workers on
   fellowship from unionization vote.***

   The main points are:

     o Applying a union labor process to a student body requires drawing
       lines between groups of students
     o The UE was the first to exclude over 2,000 students from its proposed
       bargaining unit, including students on full external fellowships
     o MIT***s current inclusive, collaborative, flexible model *** which
       supports ALL students *** is more responsive to individual students***
       needs and allows MIT to maintain important program-to-program
       differences across 108 unique masters and doctoral degree programs
     o Being in the bargaining unit could strip fellows of the flexibility
       and certain benefits they currently enjoy**

All students have academic relationships with MIT; not all have employment
relationships

   Graduate student unionization involves a labor bargaining process that is
   fundamentally about negotiating the ***terms and conditions of
   employment.*** While many graduate students have an employment
   relationship with MIT, many do not. All students have an academic
   relationship with MIT. But only student-employees can organize and become
   part of a labor union.**

   This is one of the principal reasons why the Institute***s senior leaders
   think that our current collaborative, holistic, flexible, and nimble model
   for working with all graduate students *** a model that cuts across both
   their employment and academic relationships *** is the better one for
   being responsive to individual students*** needs and for enabling MIT to
   maintain many important program-to-program differences across our 108
   unique masters and doctoral degree programs.

The UE has already excluded over 2,000 graduate students from the proposed
bargaining unit**

   Unionization requires determining who is and isn***t an employee under
   federal labor law. Because of that requirement, the UE was the first to
   exclude over 2,000 graduate students from the proposed bargaining unit
   when they filed their petition with the National Labor Relations Board
   (NLRB) on February 1, 2022.

   The UE dropped students who receive full fellowship support from external
   sources (e.g., certain awards from US federal agencies, foreign government
   agencies, corporations, or foundations) and those who are otherwise
   self-funded. These students conduct research and teaching as required by
   their academic programs, just like students who receive fellowship awards
   from MIT.

   The reason the UE did this is because they do not believe students who are
   on externally supported fellowships or who are self-funded are employees
   who can unionize under NLRB rules. MIT***s senior leaders agree. But the
   Institute***s leadership also believes that MIT internal fellows fall into
   that same non-employee category.

   Ultimately, drawing unnecessary lines between groups of students ***
   including some while excluding others *** is inconsistent with MIT***s
   values. The reason it is happening is because the UE is applying a union
   labor process to a student body.**

Asking the NLRB to confirm that fellows are not employees under federal rules

   The NLRB has ruled that a graduate student is an employee and eligible to
   unionize if the university:

     o Pays the student;
     o Directs and controls the student***s work; and**
     o Requires specific services be performed as a condition of receiving
       their funding.

   MIT***s senior leaders [10]do not believe that students on full fellowship
   appointments are employees under this rule and are asking the NLRB to
   confirm that.

   It***s worth noting that MIT is not alone in seeing a distinction between
   graduate fellows and student-workers. The graduate student union at the
   University of Iowa *** the only graduate student union affiliated with the
   UE *** does not include fellows. The same is true at Brown University and
   the University of Massachusetts.

Comparing TA/RA appointments with internal fellowships and external funding

   The below table illustrates the similarities and key differences between
   appointment and award types at MIT.

   In short, students on MIT fellowship awards are most akin to students on
   full external fellowships, and the UE has already excluded the latter
   group from their proposed bargaining unit because they do not view them as
   student employees.**

   RAs and TAs, unlike fellows and self-funded students, are generally
   required to perform specific services, or work on specific research
   projects, in order to receive their assistantship funding. This ***pay for
   services rendered*** is at the core of what it means to be an employee
   under federal labor law.**

   Bargaining Unit

   (Note: some departments also have non-service RAs that function more like
   MIT internal fellowships).

Why is being outside of the bargaining unit better for students on MIT
fellowships?

   Fellowship awards are our [11]most flexible form of financial assistance
   because they do not come with service requirements beyond the very
   rigorous academic expectations required of all students. This is why
   fellowships are regarded as the most attractive form of funding by
   students across the world when they consider admission decisions and why
   fellowships are often awarded early in a student***s academic progression.

   It is also why fellowships are frequently awarded in MIT***s
   [12]Guaranteed Transitional Support Program when students want to change
   research groups *** explicitly to remove any service requirements.

   MIT***s international students who are awarded fellowships also depend on
   the flexibility (and income) they provide, especially those with spouses
   or partners who cannot work. That***s because federal immigration law
   limits on-campus employment opportunities for international students to 20
   hours per week during the fall and spring semesters. International
   students on full RA and TA appointments are not permitted to take on other
   on-campus employment opportunities during these terms. If fellowships are
   deemed to require services and included in the bargaining unit, then
   international students awarded full fellowships would be subject to the
   same employment restrictions as RAs and TAs.**

   In short, in a unionized setting, some of the flexibility fellows
   currently enjoy would likely be eliminated. This is why, if the
   unionization effort is ultimately successful, MIT***s senior leaders think
   it is better for students with fellowship awards not to be included in the
   bargaining unit.

                           Why students are voting no

   Over the past six months, MIT graduate students have written to The Tech
   to express their concerns with forming a union aligned with the [8]United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE).**

   Before you vote on April 4-5, consider the issues these students raise
   below, and then ask yourself: Has the UE made its case to you? Has it
   provided sufficient, rigorous evidence to support its claims and promises?
   Does the UE share your values?

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [9]Why UE and what it stands for cannot represent MIT graduate students

   ***Voting yes would bind us for years to come to UE, an organization that,
   in addition to being a fiscally irresponsible choice, holds many positions
   that are unrepresentative of MIT graduate students.***These positions
   range from ill-advised to downright abhorrent; even more concerning is the
   way in which their documents distort facts, history, and context in order
   to advance their propaganda.***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [10]Why I***m voting ***no*** to the graduate student union

   ***I am concerned that a union contract will greatly reduce the
   flexibility MIT currently affords students and their advisors as they
   collaborate to answer novel research questions. This rigidity would
   ultimately reduce the quality of research MIT graduate students are able
   to conduct. Isn***t this quality of research and the freedom to work hard
   to solve unanswered questions what drew us all to MIT in the first
   place?***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [11]The UE isn***t the union the GSU claims it is

   ***I would support the Graduate Student Union (GSU) if they were
   unionizing without the UE. However, they have elected to choose a nearly
   bankrupt, predatory, and oppressive national union that supports none of
   our interests.***The UE needs us, but we do not need the UE.***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [12]Why we do not need a graduate student union at MIT

   ***In order to garner broad support for their campaign, the GSU organizers
   have begun to discredit themselves by claiming every possible issue on
   campus as something a union would solve. Every improvement is hailed as a
   ***GSU win,*** announced without any further proof that this is indeed the
   case.***But we are making great strides with our current amicable working
   relationship between the GSC and MIT.***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [13]Some concerns about unionization from a graduate student

   ***I previously worked for the government and was forced to be in a union.
   The rigidity and duration of the collective bargaining agreement imposed
   severe constraints on my ability to negotiate with superiors and optimize
   my work experience.***The prospects of unionizing are unclear, and the
   trade-offs to this point have been poorly defined by the GSU. This is not
   a free lunch, and, indeed, it is uncertain whether any manna is
   forthcoming.***

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Express YOUR view by voting next Monday and Tuesday, April 4 and 5 in a
   secret-ballot election. More information is available at

    2. MIT***s position on why graduate students with MIT fellowships should
       not be included in the MIT GSU-UE***s proposed bargaining unit

  MIT***s position on why graduate students with MIT fellowships should not be
            included in the MIT GSU-UE***s proposed bargaining unit

   The following statement explains why MIT***s senior leadership does not
   think students supported by MIT fellowship awards (but who do not also
   have partial research assistant (RA), teaching assistant (TA), or
   Instructor G appointments) are eligible to be part of the bargaining unit
   represented by the MIT Graduate Student Union and United Electrical,
   Radio, and Machine Workers of America (MIT GSU-UE). MIT has asked the
   National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to confirm that fellows are not
   employees under federal rules.

   The main points are:

     o All students have academic relationships with MIT; not all have
       employment relationships with MIT.
     o Applying a union labor process to a student body requires
       distinguishing between those who are student-employees and those who
       are students only. The National Labor Relations Act does not cover
       students but only student employees.**
     o Because of this, the MIT GSU-UE***s proposed unit would not include
       over 2,000 graduate students supported by full external fellowships
       and tuition-only fellowships, as well as those who are self-funded.**
     o Similarly, MIT senior leaders believe that students on MIT fellowship
       awards are not student-employees. They do not have service
       requirements, only the rigorous academic expectations required of all
       students.
     o The distinction between RAs/TAs and fellows also exists within federal
       research administration requirements, immigration regulations, and
       federal taxation rules, all of which MIT is required to follow.
     o MIT is asking the NLRB to confirm that graduate students on MIT
       fellowship awards are not employees under federal labor rules,
       consistent with other federal policies.
     o Being in the bargaining unit could strip fellows of some flexibilities
       and benefits that come with fellowship awards.**

All students have academic relationships with MIT; not all have employment
relationships with MIT

   Graduate student unionization involves a labor bargaining process that is
   fundamentally about negotiating the ***terms and conditions of
   employment.*** While many graduate students have an employment
   relationship with MIT, others do not. All students have an academic
   relationship with MIT. But only student-employees can organize and become
   part of a labor union. This means that both the MIT GSU-UE and MIT need to
   distinguish between those who are student-employees and those who are
   students only. **

The MIT GSU-UE***s desired bargaining unit would still exclude over 2,000
graduate students

   Because federal labor rules apply only to employees, the MIT GSU-UE***s
   desired bargaining unit (RAs, TAs, Instructor Gs, and fellows) would still
   not include over 2,000 MIT graduate students.

   The students who the MIT GSU-UE excludes are those who receive full
   fellowship support from external sources (e.g., certain awards from US
   federal agencies, foreign government agencies, corporations, or
   foundations); those on tuition-only fellowships; and those who are
   self-funded. These students conduct research and teaching as required by
   their academic programs, just like students who receive fellowship awards
   from MIT.**

   MIT senior leaders agree with the MIT GSU-UE that students on external
   fellowships, tuition-only fellowships, and self-funding are not employees
   under federal labor rules. Institute leadership further believes that MIT
   fellows also fall into the non-employee category.

Asking the NLRB to confirm that fellows are not employees under federal rules

   The NLRB has ruled that a graduate student is an employee and eligible to
   unionize if the university:

     o Pays the student;
     o Directs and controls the student***s work; and**
     o Requires specific services be performed as a condition of receiving
       their funding.

   MIT senior leaders do not believe that students on MIT fellowship awards
   are employees under this rule. They are asking the NLRB to confirm that.

   MIT is not alone in seeing a distinction between graduate fellows and
   student-employees. The graduate student union at the University of Iowa
   *** which is affiliated with the UE *** does not include fellows. The same
   is true at Brown University, the University of Massachusetts, and other
   schools.

   Similarly, at Harvard and Columbia, some graduate students are provided
   financial support to pursue their academic programs but are not included
   in the bargaining units at those schools.

   This distinction between RAs/TAs and fellows also exists in several other
   important contexts, including federal research administration
   requirements, immigration regulations, and federal taxation rules. **

Comparing fellowship awards with TA/RA appointments and external funding

   The below table illustrates the similarities and key differences between
   appointment and award types at MIT.

   Importantly, RAs and TAs are generally required to perform specific
   services, or work on specific research projects, in order to receive their
   assistantship funding. This is not true of fellows and self-funded
   students. The concept of ***pay for services rendered*** is at the core of
   what it means to be an employee under federal labor law.

                                TA  RA  MIT Fellowship External

   contracts and grants

What are some benefits that fellowship award holders have by being outside of
the bargaining unit?

   Fellowship awards are MIT***s most flexible form of financial assistance
   because they do not come with service requirements, only the rigorous
   academic expectations required of all students. Fellowships afford
   students the flexibility to choose among different specific research
   projects. For these reasons, fellowships are regarded as the most
   attractive form of funding by students across the world when they consider
   admission decisions at MIT and elsewhere, and why fellowships are often
   awarded early in a student***s academic progression.

   It is also why fellowships are frequently awarded in [10]MIT***s
   Guaranteed Transitional Support Program when students want to change
   research groups *** explicitly to remove any service requirements.

   MIT***s international students who are awarded fellowships also depend on
   the flexibility they provide, especially those with spouses or partners
   who cannot work. That is because federal immigration law limits on-campus
   employment opportunities for international students to 20 hours per week
   during the fall and spring semesters. International students on full RA
   and TA appointments are not permitted to take on other on-campus
   employment opportunities during these terms. If fellowships are deemed to
   require services and are included in the bargaining unit, then
   international students awarded full fellowships would be subject to the
   same employment restrictions as RAs and TAs.**

   In short, in a unionized setting, some of the flexibility fellows
   currently enjoy would likely be eliminated. This is why, in addition to
   their interpretation of federal rules, MIT senior leaders believe it is
   better for students with fellowship awards to remain outside the
   bargaining unit and why they have asked the NLRB to decide this matter.

   [9]MIT Campus

   On April 6, 2022, Chancellor Melissa Nobles and Vice Chancellor Ian Waitz
   [10]announced the results of the April 4-5 graduate student unionization
   election; congratulated current and past MIT GSU-UE members on their four
   years of dedicated work that culminated in the union***s election; and
   committed to bargain in good faith with the union over the terms and
   conditions of employment for bargaining unit members.

   Those initial negotiations will get underway in September 2022 and are
   likely to take at least several months to complete. At other universities
   with graduate student unions, negotiating a first contract has taken at
   least one year (from the date of certification to ratification) and, in
   several cases, multiple years.

   This website serves as a central resource with information about:

     o Which [11]graduate students are represented by the MIT GSU-UE.
     o The collective bargaining process and topics that are considered
       [12]mandatory subjects of bargaining and therefore must be discussed
       at the bargaining table.
     o Topics that are [13]non-mandatory subjects of bargaining, which means
       that employers can decide whether to bargain over them or to work
       through existing channels such as Institute committees or working
       groups.
     o The [14]latest updates, including letters and other announcements for
       the MIT community as well as, when finalized, the contract between MIT
       and the MIT GSU-UE.

   Community members with questions about unions and unionization that are
   not addressed on this website may contact**[15]gradunionquestions@mit.edu.

    2. An open letter about why the UE and what it stands for cannot
       represent MIT graduate students

  An open letter about why the UE and what it stands for cannot represent MIT
                               graduate students

   Fellow MIT Graduate Students,

   On April 4***5, we will vote on whether we wish for the United Electrical,
   Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) to represent us. Voting yes would
   bind us for years to come to UE, an organization that, in addition to
   being [15]a fiscally irresponsible choice, holds many positions that are
   unrepresentative of MIT graduate students. To list just a few:

     o They [16]do not support nuclear power.
     o They denounce collaborations with U.S. allies such as [17]Israel and
       [18]Japan.
     o They [19]support Nicol**s Maduro in Venezuela, claiming that ***the
       U.S. government and media continue to vilify his government as a
       ***dictatorship.****** **Needless to say, there is no media
       conspiracy. According to a [20]piece in The New York Times, the
       ***Maduro administration has been responsible for *** plunging the
       country into a deep humanitarian crisis***. He has also attempted to
       crush the opposition by jailing or exiling critics, and using lethal
       force against anti-government protesters.***
     o They were [21]against the expansion of NATO and Obama's support of the
       [22]2014 Ukrainian revolution, which overthrew Putin's puppet
       government in Ukraine. As late as three days before Russia invaded
       Ukraine, [23]they have maintained their anti-NATO sentiment. ****

   These positions range from ill-advised to downright abhorrent; even more
   concerning is the way in which their documents (some of which are linked
   above) distort the facts, history, and context in order to advance their
   propaganda. ****

   Regardless of how much autonomy as a local chapter we may or may not have,
   we cannot in good conscience affiliate with or financially support such an
   organization (we would be paying them approximately $2 million per year,
   nearly half of their current annual budget). We urge all graduate students
   to carefully consider not only whether they are willing to financially and
   reputationally strengthen UE, but also whether they are willing to force
   their fellow graduate students and graduate students for years to come to
   do the same.

   If the vote passes, it would be extremely difficult for us to divorce
   ourselves from UE in the future, as our relationship with MIT would
   legally be through UE. A vote no is not a vote against unionization in
   general but merely against our unionizing with UE, and would preserve our
   ability to unionize in the future, either as an independent union or as
   part of a different national one. **
   **
   UE is morally, [24]financially, and intellectually bankrupt. Whether we
   join them will be determined by a simple majority of those who vote.
   Regardless of your opinion, share this letter or otherwise inform your
   fellow graduate students about UE***s policy positions so that everyone
   can cast an informed vote.

   MIT has created this website to help every graduate student cast an
   informed vote on whether or not to form a union affiliated with the United
   Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America.**

   No one can cast an informed vote if they hear only one side of the story.
   MIT trusts its students to think for themselves, ask questions, discuss
   issues, and make decisions based on complete and accurate information.

    2. Update on MIT GSU-UE***s petition to add fellows to the current
       bargaining unit

Update on MIT GSU-UE***s petition to add fellows to the current bargaining unit

   On October 3, 2022, [10]MIT informed graduate students, faculty, and staff
   who work closely with graduate students that the MIT GSU-UE filed a
   petition^1 with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to add graduate
   students on fellowships to the current collective bargaining unit of RAs,
   TAs, and Instructor Gs^2. The NLRB held a hearing on this petition from
   October 19-24, where MIT and the union presented their respective
   positions on the petition.

   On November 10, MIT filed a [11]post-hearing brief detailing why the
   Institute maintains, [12]as it did this past spring, that graduate student
   fellows are students only***not employees***and therefore are not eligible
   to be in the MIT GSU-UE***s collective bargaining unit. Specifically, in
   the brief, MIT argues that:

   Unlike the student-employees in the current bargaining unit of research
   assistants (***RAs***), teaching assistants (***TAs***), and instructor
   Gs, fellows have no service requirements tied to their fellowship awards.
   They are not required to work on a particular faculty member/principal
   investigator***s (***PI***) research project or course in order to
   maintain their funding. Instead, their fellowship funding is akin to a
   scholarship, and they receive such funding to pursue their own academic
   programs and objectives. A fellow retains their fellowship award so long
   as they make satisfactory academic progress, which is a baseline
   requirement for all students to maintain active enrollment status at MIT.

   During the NLRB hearing, the union argued that a graduate student***s
   thesis research amounts to employment service for MIT, and, therefore, all
   fellows are employees because they perform thesis research and also
   receive financial assistance from the Institute. In its [13]brief, MIT
   highlights several serious concerns with the union***s argument,
   including:

   ***If thesis research is deemed equivalent to employment services, as [the
   union] argues, then the time an international student spends on thesis
   research would count toward the 20/hr-week employment cap set by federal
   immigration law for these students. This would result in an inequitable
   two-tiered system where MIT***s international students would be unable to
   dedicate sufficient time to their theses to make satisfactory academic
   progress or, at a minimum, would require significantly more time to obtain
   their degrees as compared to their domestic-student peers.

   MIT***s concerns about the union***s argument extend beyond students on
   fellowship awards. Specifically, if the NLRB were to accept the union***s
   position that thesis research is equivalent to employment, this would
   mean:

   ***International graduate students on full-time TA appointments would not
   be able to conduct any research during the terms in which they hold TA
   appointments.

   International graduate students on full-time RA appointments would not be
   able to conduct any research beyond the 20 hours/week spent performing
   their RA duties, even if their RA research is entirely distinct from, and
   does not advance, their thesis research***as is the case in several of
   MIT***s departments.

   For international students on full fellowship awards, MIT would be
   required to cap their total research time at 20 hours per week.

   Any international students who exceed 20 hours of weekly research work
   would be in violation of the terms of their visas and subject to
   deportation.

   Moreover, in all of these situations above, the MIT brief makes the case
   that if fellows are determined to be employees and included in the current
   collective bargaining unit***

   ***international students would experience substantial delays in their
   ability to advance their academic work and, accordingly, would require
   additional semesters (if not years) to graduate. And, ironically, a
   student***s receipt of a full-time RA or TA appointment***which is a
   mechanism for providing financial assistance to a student so they can
   pursue their academic program***would actually prohibit an international
   student from separately pursuing the very academic program that the RA/TA
   appointment was meant to support in the first place.

   Those wishing to learn more about the position MIT outlines in the brief
   can read:

     o The [14]preliminary statement
     o The [15]argument^4
     o The [16]full document

   The MIT GSU-UE, in parallel, filed their own [17]post-hearing brief. The
   NLRB will now review both briefs. It will likely be several weeks or
   months before the NLRB issues a decision. In the meantime, MIT remains
   committed to negotiating in good faith with the union over the terms and
   conditions of employment for student-employees currently in the bargaining
   unit.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ^1Representation petitions are filed by employees or unions seeking to
   have the NLRB conduct an election to determine if employees wish to be
   represented for purposes of collective bargaining with their employer
   ([18]source).

   ^2See the [19]full description of the current bargaining unit.

   ^3Students in F-1 or J-1 status are [20]allowed to work on campus (at MIT,
   for MIT, paid by MIT) up to 20 hours per week while school is in session
   (fall and spring semesters). Students can work on campus more than 20
   hours a week only during official Institute vacation periods of at least
   one week in length (IAP, Spring Break, summer).

   ^4Argument sections:

   I. Graduate students on fellowship awards at the Institute are not
   employees within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the act.

   II. The petitioner***s legal arguments are flawed and its rebuttal
   evidence is insufficient to establish that fellows are employees under the
   act.

   III.**The petitioner***s contention that all research done by a fellow
   constitutes employment work is erroneous and can lead to adverse and
   unintended consequences for the Institute, the petitioner and to the
   fellows.

   IV.**Similar public sector case law supports MIT***s position that fellows
   who are not expected to provide any services to their universities are not
   employees.

   V. Industry practice supports MIT***s position because other collective
   bargaining agreements have excluded fellows, or those with comparable
   titles, from units of graduate research and teaching assistants.

Notice of subpoena requiring MIT to share graduate student information with NLRB
                                     and UE

   To MIT graduate students,**

   Below, please find important information about MIT***s obligation to
   provide personally-identifiable information about its graduate students to
   the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and United Electrical, Radio and
   Machine Workers of America (UE). This requirement stems from [8]the
   graduate student unionization effort that is underway.

Subpoena requires MIT to provide graduate student information to the NLRB and UE
by noon on February 17th

   As part of the process initiated by the United Electrical, Radio and
   Machine Workers of America (UE), MIT recently received a subpoena from the
   NLRB which requires the Institute to provide students*** names, work
   locations/departments, and job classifications/appointment types to the
   NLRB and UE on or before noon on February 17th. A [9]copy of the
   subpoena**is available for review.

   Once the NLRB determines who is eligible to vote in the union election,
   the subpoena also requires MIT to disclose additional information about
   those eligible voters. This additional information, which includes home
   addresses, personal email addresses, and home and personal telephone
   numbers, will be disclosed at a later date. Please note that, once this
   information is provided, it may be used by the UE as part of their
   campaigning efforts.

Notice of disclosure under MIT policy and federal student privacy rules**

   The information sought by the NLRB subpoena constitutes ***education
   records*** as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
   (***FERPA***) (20 U.S.C. ** 1232g(b)(2) and 34 C.F.R. Part 99), a federal
   law that protects the privacy of student records. Therefore, consistent
   with FERPA and [10]MIT***s policy on the privacy of student records, MIT
   is notifying you about the subpoena and the Institute***s obligation to
   produce the information described above.

   There is no action required on your part. However, if you wish to seek
   protective action to prevent some or all of these disclosures, you may
   have to initiate a separate court action. You should take this step as
   soon as possible. MIT will produce the initial set of information
   requested by the subpoena no earlier than the morning of February 17.
   Please note that MIT requested and received additional time (to February
   17) to produce the requested information, so that MIT could provide this
   notice and afford students time to seek protective action. MIT will
   produce the additional, more comprehensive set of information about
   eligible voters at a later date, which will be determined by the NLRB.

   If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to
   [11]gradunionquestions@mit.edu. MIT encourages all graduate students to
   learn more about the unionization process by visiting
   [12]grad-union.mit.edu.
